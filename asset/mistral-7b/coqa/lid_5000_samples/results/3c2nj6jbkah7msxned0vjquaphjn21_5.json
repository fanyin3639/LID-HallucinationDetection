        "Answer the following questions:\nContext: Bill and Sarah chose to meet at the park on Saturday to play ball and have a picnic. They went to the same grade school together and lived on the same street down from the park. Sarah does not often like boys, but for a boy, Bill was alright. Most boys like Tom and Mark are stupid and a real pain, but Bill was a lot of fun to play with and didn't do dumb things like putting a booger on her back during recess. When Bill and Sarah arrived at the park, they first played ball in the grass near the playground. Then they chose to pretend that Bill was a monster and Sarah was the monster hunter. Sarah chased Bill all over the playground. They went in and out and up and down. Bill ran under the slide and stepped in a puddle. He didn't get hurt but he sure got plenty wet. Playing the monster game was the most fun that they had at the park that day. Later they sat in the grass for a picnic. They both took off their shoes so that Bill's feet could dry off and so that he wouldn't feel silly without shoes. Sarah took out her lunch and laid it out next to her. She had dried fruit and cheese and a peanut butter sandwich. Bill opened his lunch bag and found a coke, a bag of chips, and a ham salad sandwich. Sarah wanted to trade Bill his bag of chips for her fruit. He said that would be a fair trade and they enjoyed their lunch together. After they had their lunch, they lay back in the grass and watched the clouds. Some clouds looked like animals or shapes. Bill spotted one that looked like a reindeer. Sarah pointed to one that looked like a drum. Finally Bill and Sarah got up and brushed off the grass and headed for home.\n'Question': Why?\n'Answer: 'Because'\n'Question': Why?\n'Answer: 'Because'\n'Question': Why?\n'Answer: 'Because'\n'Question': Why?\n'Answer: 'Because'\n'Question': Why?\n'Answer: 'Because'\n'Question': Why?",
