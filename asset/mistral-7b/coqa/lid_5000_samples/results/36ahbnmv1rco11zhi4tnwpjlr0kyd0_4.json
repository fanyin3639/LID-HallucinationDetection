        "Answer the following questions:\nContext: (CNN) -- Manchester City thrashed Sunderland 5-0 to keep alive their slim English Premier League title hopes and to cement their position in the top four Champions League places. \n\nEngland international Adam Johnson, making his first start since injuring his ankle in January, opened the scoring in the ninth minute while captain Carlos Tevez doubled the Blues' advantage on the quarter hour from the penalty spot. \n\nSecond-half strikes from David Silva, Patrick Vieira and Yaya Toure completed the rout as City went above reigning champions Chelsea into third in the standings. \n\nThey are six points clear of fifth-placed Tottenham, who pipped them for the final Champions League place last season, but have played a game more. \n\nLeaders Manchester United have a seven-point lead over Arsenal, who have played a game less, with their neighbors City 10 points adrift. \n\nThe strikes from Johnson, who exchanged passes with Toure before finishing neatly, and Tevez, who was fouled by Michael Turner to draw the penalty, effectively ended the match as a contest with City always in command against a Sunderland side in poor recent form. \n\nSilva scored after a Mario Balotelli shot was blocked, Vieira with his first touch after coming off the bench and Toure after an error by Sunderland captain Lee Cattermole. \n\nCity's Dutch international Nigel de Jong said the result was important for their Champions League ambitions. \n\n\"There are still seven games to go and anything can happen but this is a great confidence boost for our team -- we are real contenders for the Champions League places.\" he told Sky Sports. \n'Question': Why had he not been playing?\n'Answer: 'He had an ankle injury.\n'Question': What does it mean for their Champions League hopes?\n'Answer: 'It's a big boost for us.
