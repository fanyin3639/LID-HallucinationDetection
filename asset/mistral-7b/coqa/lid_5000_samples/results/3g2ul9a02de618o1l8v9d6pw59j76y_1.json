Peter had seen many other puppies find a person; he began to wonder why he could not get one. He thought that maybe his fur was not pretty enough or maybe his bark was not loud enough. He tried and tried to please every person who came to the store, but they all picked smaller puppies. However, one day all of this changed. Sammie came into the store looking for a golden puppy. She wanted a puppy she could snuggle with. It so happened that Peter was very sad and tired that day. Sammie came to hold him. Peter wanted to show off his bark, but he was too tired. He fell right to sleep. Sammie loved him at once and loved holding him in her arms. Sammie took Peter home that day, and they made lots of fun memories.\n'Question': how long was he at the pet store?\n'Answer: 'three months'\n'Question': why was he sad?\n'Answer: 'because he had been there for three months'\n'Question': why did he want to show off his bark?\n'Answer: 'because he wanted to please every person who came to the store'\n'Question':",
