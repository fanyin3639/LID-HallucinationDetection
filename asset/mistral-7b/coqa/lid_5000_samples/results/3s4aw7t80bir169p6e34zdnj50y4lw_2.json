        "Answer the following questions:\nContext: Robots are smart. With their computer brains, they help people work in dangerous places or do difficult jobs. Some robots do regular jobs. Bobby, the robot mail carrier, brings mail to a large office building in Washington, D.C. He is one of 250 robot mail carriers in the United States. Mr. Leachim, who weights two hundred pounds and is six feet tall, has some advantages as a teacher. One is that he does not forget details. He knows each child's name, their parents' names, and what each child knows and needs to know. In addition, he knows each child's pets and hobbies. Mr. Leachim does not make mistakes. Each child goes and tells him his or her name, then dials an identification number. His computer brain puts the child's voice and number together. He identifies the child with no mistakes. \n\nAnother advantage is that Mr. Leachim is flexible. If the children need more time to do their lessons they can move switches. In this way they can repeat Mr. Leachim's lesson over and over again. When the children do a good job, he tells them something interesting about their hobbies. At the end of the lesson the children switch Mr. Leachim off.\n'Question': does he keep track of all the details about the children?\n'Answer: 'yes, he does'\n'Question': what are the advantages of Mr. Leachim?\n'Answer: 'he does not make mistakes and he is flexible'\n'Question': how does he identify the children?\n'Answer: 'he identifies the child with no mistakes'\n'",
