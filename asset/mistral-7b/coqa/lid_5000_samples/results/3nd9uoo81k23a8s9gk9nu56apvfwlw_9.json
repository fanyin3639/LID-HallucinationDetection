        "Answer the following questions:\nContext: (CNN) -- We should all be so lucky to have friends like Elvis Cole and Joe Pike. Private detectives in modern-day Los Angeles, they're the stars of best-selling author Robert Crais' award-winning series of crime novels. Elvis and Joe have been busting bad guys and thrilling millions of readers since 1987's \"The Monkey's Raincoat.\" The books are international bestsellers, published in 42 countries, and have developed a fervent following. \n\nIn \"Taken,\" Crais's newest novel, his 15th featuring the daring duo, Elvis and Joe take on an especially bloodthirsty group of criminals called bajadores. They are bandits who prey on other bandits along the U.S.-Mexico border, dealing in drugs, murder and kidnapping. \n\n\"Taken\" is intense and fast-paced and reads like a big-budget Hollywood blockbuster. Though that's not surprising when you consider Crais began his career writing for television series like \"Hill Street Blues,\" \"Cagney & Lacey\" and \"Miami Vice.\" \n\nCNN recently spoke to the author about his new book, his loyal fans and why he's refused to bring Elvis and Joe to the big screen. The following is an edited transcript. \n\nCNN: How has writing about Elvis Cole and Joe Pike changed over the course of the series? \n\nCrais: I really strive to bring something new to each book. I don't want to write the same book over and over again. I've done Elvis books; I've done Joe books; I've done mixed books, but this time, I made a conscious decision I wanted to tell a story where I could split the book pretty much down the middle and give them 50-50 equal footing so they both have their starring roles. When I discovered this particular story, it just seemed a perfect way to do that. Part of the book, they're working together. Then there's Elvis' track through the story, and there's Joe track, where he's trying to find Elvis and save him. So it just seemed like an ideal way to let these guys share the stage. \n'Question': What type of blockbuster is Taken?\n'Answer: 'Taken' is an action thriller. It's a book that's really fast-paced.
