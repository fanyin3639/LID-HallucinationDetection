        "Answer the following questions:\nContext: One summer when I was sixteen, I planted a vegetable garden. I wanted a bunch of different vegetables, so I planted seven tomato plants, three pepper plants, six corn plants, and two cucumber plants. My mom loves zucchini so I also planted ten zucchini plants. I watered the garden daily with a watering can. When weeds started to take over, I pulled them back. About a month in, I started getting fresh vegetables every day. I walked to the garden with a big basket every morning and picked the vegetables that were ready. Sometimes I ate them right off the vine. One day I walked down to the garden and saw that the zucchini plants were taking over. Each of my ten plants had many zucchini, giving me hundreds of zucchinis each week. I didn't know what to do with the zucchini so I gave some to my neighbor. I gave some to my parents to take to their friends. Then I went door to door and gave zucchini to everyone in the neighborhood.\n'Question': Before vegetables started to sprout what took over the garden?\n'Answer: ' Weeds\n'Question': How did you water your garden?\n'Answer: ' I watered the garden with a watering can.\n'Question': How many vegetables did you plant?\n'Answer: ' I planted seven tomato plants, three pepper plants, six corn plants, and two",
