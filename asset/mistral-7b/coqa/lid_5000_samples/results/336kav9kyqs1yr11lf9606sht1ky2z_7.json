        "Answer the following questions:\nContext: Annie was helping her little brother Max pick flowers from the garden. They wanted to put the flowers in a jar to put on the kitchen table. Mother's Day was the next day and their mother loved fresh flowers. \n\nAfter they picked flowers and put them in a jar, Max asked Annie if they could have a snack. Annie took Max into the kitchen and got out an apple to slice up. They sat down at the table looking at the flowers and ate their apple slices. There was a window in the kitchen that let in sunlight. \n\n\"Hey!\" Max said, pointing at one of the roses in the jar. \"There's something moving on that rose.\" \n\nAnnie looked more closely at the flowers. \"It's a ladybug,\" she said. \"We need to take it back outside.\" \n\nSuddenly the ladybug began flying around the kitchen. Max jumped up and ran around trying to catch it. At last he clapped his hands around it. \"Careful!\" said Annie. \n\nMax walked outside and let the ladybug go.\n'Question': What did they do with them?\n'Answer: 'They put them in a jar.'\n\nI don't understand the answer. Why can't we put the flowers in a jar?\n\nThanks in advance.",
