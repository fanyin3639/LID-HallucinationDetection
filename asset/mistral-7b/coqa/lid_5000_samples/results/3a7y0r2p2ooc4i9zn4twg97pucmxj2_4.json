Methodical Phoebe felt herself in disgrace, and yet, somehow, she could not be sorry enough; she wanted a reprieve from exile at Hiltonbury, alone and away from all that was going on. At least she should hear whether _Macbeth_, at the Princess's Theatre, fulfilled Mr. Randolf's conceptions of it; and if Mr. Currie approved his grand map of the Newcastle district, with the little trees that she had taught him to draw. \n'Question': Who is Cecily's sister?\n'Answer: 'She is the wife of an officer.'\n\n'Question': What is the meaning of the following sentence: 'Mervyn, how can I go?
