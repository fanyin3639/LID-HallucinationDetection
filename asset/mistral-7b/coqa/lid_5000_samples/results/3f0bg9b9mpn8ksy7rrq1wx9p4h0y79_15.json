        "Answer the following questions:\nContext: Scott Alan woke up very early that morning in his bedroom in his house. He felt something licking his face and he wasn't sure what it was. As he opened his green eyes slowly, he saw a bit of fur. Then he saw a tongue. After that, some more fur and then slurp! He was licked again! \n\n\"Oh, Boscoe!\" the little boy said with joy as he kissed his furry little brown dog. The dog had been Scott's friend for as long as could remember. They went on many adventures together. The two of them really never left each other's side and Scott woke up many times this way. \n\nOne of the most memorable adventures that Scott and Boscoe had happened when Scott was 12. Scott wanted to have a little fun. He also wanted to adventure with Boscoe. Scott had got done eating breakfast and wanted to ride his bicycle. Boscoe was walking and Scott was riding his bicycle down by the park very close to the river near Scott's house. He wanted to do a little adventuring. Boscoe was walking next to the shore and started barking his head off! Scott wasn't sure what he was barking at, so he got off his bicycle and ran down into the river to see what all the noise was about. \n\nAll of the sudden, Boscoe fell in the water and was taken down stream with the fast water. Scott yelled, \"Boscoe!\" and he was off. He jumped into the water and began swimming after Boscoe. Boscoe's little legs were doggy paddling as fast as they could, but had no hope! Finally, Scott caught up to him, but he couldn't get back to the side of the river! \n\nAs Scott was thinking this was the last of him and Boscoe, a large stick from a fallen log was well in reach and Scott grabbed it and using all of this might, he pulled him and Boscoe out of the river. \n\n\"Boy, was that close!\" Scott yelled out loud! \n\nThat was the best adventure ever!\n'Question': what happened to the animal all of a sudden?\n'Answer: 'The animal was licking Scott's face.\n'Question: 'What did Scott do?\n'Answer: 'He kissed Boscoe.\n'Question: 'What was the adventure?\n'Answer: 'The adventure was when Boscoe fell in the river.\n'Question:",
