        "Answer the following questions:\nContext: I am going to get a hamster in a few weeks, or maybe a month! I have been waiting for a hamster for years, so I don't want to wait another day! She's going to have a big home with lots of paper towel rolls to eat, or even sleep in. My little hamster is going to bite me in the beginning, as hamsters are nervous, but we're going to end up being best friends. She's going to sit on my shoulder as I do the dishes or do my homework. When I'm reading my favorite book, sleeping, or when I'm showering, my hamster needs to go back to her home. I think that she is going to pee without warning and at the worst times, I am going to scratch her little belly and love her all the more when she pushes carrots into her mouth. I am sure that my little hamster is going to get into a lot more trouble, too. Maybe she'll be scared of thunder and try to run away. Or maybe she'll be so curious about going outside to the street that she might get hurt. I do not care about the amount of trouble that my little hamster gets into I'll always make sure she has water to drink, food to eat, and love from my heart.\n'Question': What will she eat?\n'Answer: 'She'll eat a lot of different things.
