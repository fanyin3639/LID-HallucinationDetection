And Cowboy was not a very nice cat. Cowboy liked to bite and chew and scratch a great many things. When Cowboy was happy, which was not very often, Cowboy liked to bite in to a blanket or soft toy and carry it around in his mouth. When Cowboy was hungry he liked to bite bright red tomatoes and suck out all the juice and seeds. And when Cowboy was feeling mean he liked to hide. Cowboy would hide, curled up tight in a ball under a blanket or behind a corner and wait for one of the little kids to pass by. When they did pass by Cowboy would jump at their feet and try to bite and scratch them. He did not know that what he was doing was not very nice. Cowboy was only a cat. A great big cat that did not know any better.\n'Question': What kind of pet did the kids have?\n'Answer: 'The kids had a cat.\n'Question: 'How did the kids feel about Cowboy?\n'Answer: 'The kids did not like Cowboy. They did not like the way he bit and scratched and chewed things. They did not like the way he hid and jumped out at them",
