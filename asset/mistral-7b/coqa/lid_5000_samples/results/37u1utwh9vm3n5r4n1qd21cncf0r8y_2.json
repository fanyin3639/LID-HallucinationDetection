Mrs. Harper checked to see if everyone was present. Each child called out when they heard their name. She then asked for a volunteer to read a story about a family of grasshoppers.

Mrs. Harper told her to go get some water to drink and a boy named Henry finished the story. Next, Mrs. Harper showed the class a butterfly garden. Someone asked if butterflies ate other bugs. Mrs. Harper said that butterflies don't eat but only drink. Josie was chosen to pass out turkey sandwiches for lunch. Mrs. Harper went to the refrigerator.
