Luckily, the Academy has proven itself to be pretty darn predictable over the years. If you're America's Sweetheart, you'll probably win Best Actress. If you sing in a flick, you are almost guaranteed Oscar gold.

In many ways, Marion won for playing the Britney Spears of 1950s France. \n'Question': Who got the 2008 one?\n'Answer: 'Julie Christie'\n\nI'm not sure if I've ever seen a movie with a better cast than \"A Beautiful Mind.\" Russell Crowe won Best Actor for his portrayal of John Nash, a brilliant mathematician who also suffered from paranoid schizophren",
