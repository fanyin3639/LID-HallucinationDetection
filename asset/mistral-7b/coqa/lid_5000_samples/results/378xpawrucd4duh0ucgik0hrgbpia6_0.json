        "Answer the following questions:\nContext: A social class (or, simply, class), as in class society, is a set of subjectively defined concepts in the social sciences and political theory centered on models of social stratification in which people are grouped into a set of hierarchical social categories, the most common being the upper, middle, and lower classes. \n\nClass is a subject of analysis for sociologists, political scientists, anthropologists, and social historians. However, there is not a consensus on a definition of \"class\", and the term has a wide range of sometimes conflicting meanings. In common parlance, the term \"social class\" is usually synonymous with \"socio-economic class\", defined as \"people having the same social, economic, cultural, political or educational status\", e.g., \"the working class\"; \"an emerging professional class\". However, academics distinguish social class and socioeconomic status, with the former referring to one\u2019s relatively stable sociocultural background and the latter referring to one\u2019s current social and economic situation and, consequently, being more changeable over time. \n\nThe precise measurements of what determines social class in society has varied over time. Karl Marx thought \"class\" was defined by one's relationship to the means of production (their relations of production). His simple understanding of classes in modern capitalist society, are the proletariat, those who work but do not own the means of production; and the bourgeoisie, those who invest and live off of the surplus generated by the former. This contrasts with the view of the sociologist Max Weber, who argued \"class\" is determined by economic position, in contrast to \"social status\" or \"\"Stand\"\" which is determined by social prestige rather than simply just relations of production.\n'Question': What is one group that analyzes classes?\n'Answer: 'Sociologists'\n'Question': What is the difference between class and socioeconomic status?\n'Answer: 'Social class is one\u2019s relatively stable sociocultural background and the latter refers to one\u2019s current social and economic situation and, consequently, being more changeable over time",
