There were a pile of blue papers and some ominous-looking envelopes on the table before him, and Paul could not help noticing the intense pallor of the hand which rested upon them. \n\n\"I wish you would let a fellow know what time you were coming,\" Arthur said, rather peevishly, but with an attempt at a smile. \"I didn't expect you till evening, so I was having a shack before dressing. I was late last night!\" \n\nPaul banished his gravity, as far as possible, and stood with his hands in his pockets, leaning against the mantel-piece. He heartily disliked the part of mentor, and he did not wish to play it, unless he were obliged. \n\n\"It was beastly early to get up,\" he said, \"but the connection at Normanton is so much better. One has to wait two hours by the late train, and Normanton is such a hole. I don't know that I should have come up to town at all, just yet,\" he continued after a slight pause, \"only that I'm on the committee at the club this term, you know, and I haven't attended a single meeting yet.
