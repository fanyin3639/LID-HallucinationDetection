It was made of metal, and looked worn and old. The girl said, this bell gave me my wish for a pink dress, but in order to keep my wish, I have to give the bell to someone else. Ring the bell three times to get your wish. Not two, not four, but three. When your wish arrives, give the bell to someone else.

It was black with brown and white spots. He picked the puppy up and hugged it. Then he saw his friend Alice. He gave the bell to Alice, who rang the bell and wished for a pretty bird. Soon a pretty bird landed on her shoulder. Alice thought the bell was a wonderful thing, and chose to keep it, rather than give it away. The next day when she woke up, her bird had flown away.\n'Question': Was she dressed in blue?\n'Answer: 'No'\n'Question': Was she dressed in pink?\n'Answer: 'No'\n'Question': Was she dressed in green?\n'Answer: 'No'\n'Question': Was she dressed in yellow?\n'Answer: 'No'\n'Question': Was she dressed in",
