The lady told me her name was Helen and she called the restaurant she and her husband were going to have lunch at after her appointment to see if he was waiting for her there.She explained that she thought her husband parked the car in the parking lot and waited for her in the car but she didn't find him there so she returned to see if he entered the medical building,but Ed was not there either.She regretted making her husband park the car alone since some signs of Alzheimer's had happened in his behavior.I asked a few nurses to help look for Ed inside and outside the medical building according to Helen's description.Then I offered to drive Helen to the restaurant to see if Ed was waiting for her there. On arriving at the parking lot of the restaurant,Helen began to search for Ed's car but she failed,which suggested Ed wasn't there.We decided to have a talk with the manager before we returned to the hospital.On our way to the manager's office.I received a call from a nurse,who said they had found Ed.What a relief!
