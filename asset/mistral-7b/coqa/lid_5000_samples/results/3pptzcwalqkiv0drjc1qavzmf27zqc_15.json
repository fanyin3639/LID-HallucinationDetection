It was made of metal, and looked worn and old. The girl said, this bell gave me my wish for a pink dress, but in order to keep my wish, I have to give the bell to someone else. Ring the bell three times to get your wish. Not two, not four, but three. When your wish arrives, give the bell to someone else. Pedro thanked the girl for the bell, and when she had gone, he rang the bell three times and wished for a puppy. Soon after, he saw a puppy on a street corner. It was black with brown and white spots. He picked the puppy up and hugged it. Then he saw his friend Alice. He gave the bell to Alice, who rang the bell and wished for a pretty bird. Soon a pretty bird landed on her shoulder. Alice thought the bell was a wonderful thing, and chose to keep it, rather than give it away. The next day when she woke up, her bird had flown away.\n'Question': What happened to her bird?\n'Answer: 'The bird flew away.\n'Question': What happened to Alice?\n'Answer: She got a new bird.\n'Question': What happened to Pedro?\n'Answer: He got a puppy.\n'Question': What happened to the girl in the pink dress?\n'Answer:",
