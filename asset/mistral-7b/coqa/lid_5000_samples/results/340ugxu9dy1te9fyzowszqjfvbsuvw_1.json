It was also said that she could _ a share of up to $30,000 reward money. \n\nVicki Brown, 30, played a very important role in ending the nationwide manhunt. Vicki, who has worked at the Royal Hotel for four years, told of her terrible experience when she had to steal into Bieber's bedroom and to watch him secretly.

But when I opened the hotel door and saw 20 armed policemen lined up in the car park, I was so glad they were there.\" \n\nThe alarm had been raised because Vicki became suspicious of the guest who checked in at 3 p.m. the day before New Year's Eve with little luggage and wearing sunglasses and a hat pulled down over his face. She said, \"He didn't seem to want to talk too much or make any eye contact.\" Vicki, the only employee on duty, called her bosses Margaret, 64, and her husband Stall McKale, 65, who phoned the police at 11 p.m. \n\nOfficers from Northumbria Police called Vicki at the hotel in Dunston, Gateshead, at about 11:30 p.m. to make sure that this was the wanted man. Then they kept in touch by phoning Vicki every 15 minutes. \n\n\"It was about ten past two in the morning when the phone went again and a policeman said 'Would you go and make yourself known to the armed officers outside?' My heart missed a beat.\" \n\nVicki quietly showed eight armed officers through passages and staircases to the top floor room and handed over the key. \n\n\"I realized that my bedroom window overlooks that pair of the hotel, so I went to watch.
