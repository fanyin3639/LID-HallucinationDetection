        "Answer the following questions:\nContext: (CNN) -- FBI agents on Friday night searched the Maryland home of the suspect in the recent disappearance of an American woman in Aruba, an agent said. \n\nThe search is occurring in the Gaithersburg residence of Gary Giordano, who is currently being held in an Aruban jail, FBI Special Agent Rich Wolf told CNN. \n\nAgents, wearing vests that said FBI and carrying empty cardboard and plastic boxes, arrived about 8:40 p.m. Friday. About 15 unmarked cars could be seen on the street, as well as a Montgomery County police vehicle. \n\nSupervisory Special Agent Philip Celestini, who was at the residence, declined to comment further on the search, citing the active investigation. \n\nAruban Solicitor General Taco Stein said earlier Friday that the suspect will appear in court Monday, where an investigating magistrate could order him held for at least eight more days, order him to remain on the island or release him outright due to a lack of evidence. \n\nGiordano was arrested by Aruban police on August 5, three days after Robyn Gardner was last seen near Baby Beach on the western tip of the Caribbean island. \n\nGiordano told authorities that he had been snorkeling with Gardner when he signaled to her to swim back, according to a statement. When he reached the beach, Gardner was nowhere to be found, Giordano allegedly said. \n\nThe area that Giordano led authorities to is a rocky, unsightly location that locals say is not a popular snorkeling spot. \n\nAlthough prosecutors have continued to identify the 50-year-old American man by his initials, GVG, they also released a photo of a man who appears to be Giordano. His attorney, Michael Lopez, also has said that his client is being held as a suspect in Gardner's death. Lopez has not returned telephone calls seeking comment. \n'Question': Why?\n'Answer: 'Because the FBI has jurisdiction over federal crimes, including kidnapping, which is a federal crime.\n\n'Question': Why would they search his home?\n'Answer': Because they are looking for evidence that will help them determine whether or not he is guilty of a federal crime.\n\n'Question':",
