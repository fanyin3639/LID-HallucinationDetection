        "Answer the following questions:\nContext: Harry is a boy with a learning disability. On his fourth birthday, he was given a pug called Millie. Two weeks after the dog's arrival, he was happier and calmer and said his first words, \"dog\" and \"mummy\". Just two months later, thieves stole the dog, and now the heartbroken little boy is back to where he started. He has refused to talk since losing his best friend. His mother was worried and gave him another dog, but he just \"pushed it away\". Mrs Hainsworth, his mother, says, \"My son is very sad. He'll go over to her cage and just beat on the bars. There is no word coming out, but you just know he's screaming 'Where is Millie' inside. Millie was really his best friend. They would play together happily for hours.

Maureen Hennis of the charity, Pets as Therapy, says she has seen many cases of dogs helping people with speech problems. \"People may talk to a dog when they wouldn't like to talk to another human,\" she says. \"A dog doesn't care if words come out wrong.\"\n'Question': Who was his best friend?\n'Answer: 'Millie'\n\n'Question': What happened to Millie?\n'Answer: 'She was stolen by thieves'\n\n'Question': What did Mrs Hainsworth give Harry after Millie was stolen?\n'Answer: 'Another dog'\n\n'Question': What happened",
