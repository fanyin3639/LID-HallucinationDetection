The child had a lot of fun. The animals were very friendly, and the friendliest of all was a baby tiger, which the child called 'kitty'. The mother laughed when her child asked to see a unicorn.

The mother threw their trash in the trashcan when they were done. Then they went to go see the pigs. The pigs made a noise like 'oink'. There were also cows. There was also a slide. The slide was a water slide, and the child begged her mother to let her go down it. At the end of the day, the child was dirty and tired, but she had a lot of fun.\n'Question': What grade were they in?\n'Answer: 'Kindergarten'\n'Question': What did the child call the tiger?\n'Answer: 'Kitty'\n'Question': What did the mother give her child?\n'Answer: 'A cookie'\n'Question': What did they have for lunch?\n'Answer:",
