        "Answer the following questions:\nContext: Tom goes everywhere with Catherine Green, a 54-year-old secretary. He moves around her office at work and goes shopping with her. \"Most people don't seem to mind Tom,\" says Catherine, who thinks he is wonderful. \"He's my fourth child,\" she says. She may think of him and treat him that way as her son. He moves around buying his food, paying his health bills and his taxes, but in fact Tom is a dog. \n\nCatherine and Tom live in Sweden, a country where everyone is expected to lead an orderly life according to rules laid down by the government, which also provides a high level of care for its people. This level of care costs money. \n\nPeople in Sweden pay taxes on everything, so aren't surprised to find that owning a dog means more taxes. Some people are paying as much as 500 Swedish kronor in taxes a year for the right to keep their dog, which is spent by the government on dog hospitals and sometimes medical treatment for a dog that falls ill. However, most such treatment is expensive, so owners often decide to offer health and even life _ for their dog. \n\nIn Sweden dog owners must pay for any damage their dog does. A Swedish Kennel Club official explains what this means: if your dog runs out on the road and gets hit by a passing car, you, as the owner, have to pay for any damage done to the car, even if your dog has been killed in the accident.\n'Question': Does he go to the office with her?\n'Answer: 'Yes'\n\n'Question': Does he go shopping with her?\n'Answer: 'Yes'\n\n'Question': What does Catherine think of him?\n'Answer: 'She thinks he is wonderful.'\n\n'Question': What does she call him?\n'Answer: 'She",
