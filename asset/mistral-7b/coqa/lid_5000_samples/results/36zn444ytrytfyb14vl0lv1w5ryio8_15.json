For 31 consecutive years (1970\u20132000) he had at least one song in the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. His tribute single, re-penned in dedication to the late Princess Diana, \"Candle in the Wind 1997\" sold over 33million copies worldwide and is the best-selling single in the history of the UK and US singles charts. He has also composed music, produced records, and has occasionally acted in films. John owned Watford Football Club from 1976 to 1987, and 1997 to 2002.
