        "Answer the following questions:\nContext: One morning, I woke up and went downstairs for breakfast. I fixed my normal breakfast: hot pickles, marshmallows, and ketchup. First I heat up the pickles on the stove, then I put the marshmallows in the toaster as I pour out my small plate of ketchup. Delicious! I eat it every morning, often with a tall glass of lemonade. \n\nI sat down at the table to eat, and looked out the window at the birds in my yard. Sometimes I see skunks outside, and once I saw a small pot-bellied pig. But today there were only a few flamingos. I opened up the book I was reading, \"All About Birds.\" I had finished the chapter on pigeons, and was moving on to robins. \n\nWhile putting ketchup on my marshmallows, I felt something tickling my neck. I looked down, and there was a daddy long-legs, climbing up! I had never seen one so close to my face. \n\n\"Er, what's up?\" I asked. \n\n\"Not much,\" he said. \"I smelled the hot pickles, and wanted to have a taste.\" \n\n\"Sure, little guy,\" I said. I put a small piece of pickle on my finger and held it out. While I was doing that, that sneaky daddy-long-legs ran down my arm. He grabbed the rest of my pickle, and ran out the door! And that was the last time I gave a pickle to a spider at breakfast.\n'Question': What is near the table?\n'Answer: 'The birds in my yard.'\n'Question': What is in the yard?\n'Answer: 'The birds.'\n'Question': What is in the book?\n'Answer: 'The robins.'\n'Question': What is on the finger?\n'Answer: 'The pickle",
