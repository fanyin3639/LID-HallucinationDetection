Although there hasn't been a coup since that year, there were attempted coups in 1996 and 2000, and President Raul Cubas resigned amid controversy in 1999. \n\nThe military shakeup is the third since Lugo took office. The former Catholic bishop was elected to a five-year term last year. His victory brought an end to six decades of one-party rule in Paraguay, but the honeymoon did not last long. \n\nIn April, Lugo admitted that he fathered a child while he was still a priest and that he may have fathered more.
