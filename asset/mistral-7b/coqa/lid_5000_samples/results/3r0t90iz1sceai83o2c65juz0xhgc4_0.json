        "Answer the following questions:\nContext: There was once a small, grey cat that lived in the woods. This was a lonely old cat that spent most of his time bullying other small animals that lived in the woods. Almost all of the other little animals who lived in the woods knew of the old cat, and warned everyone they knew to stay away from him. \n\nOne day a young mouse was out taking a walk to collect some berries. It was a nice day out, so the mouse chose to go down by the river to take a quick rest for a bit. When the mouse arrived at the river he found the perfect spot to rest. It was a small little area with soft sand to lie on, under a tree that gave a bit of shade. The mouse then sat back. After a little bit of time the mouse was fast asleep. \n\nNot long after the mouse had fallen asleep, the cat caught a scent in the air of the young mouse. The cat walked slowly up to the spot where the mouse was sleeping and licked his lips. Right when the cat was about to catch the mouse, the mouse woke up. \n\n\"What are you doing?!\" asked the mouse in surprise. \n\n\"I am trying to find dinner,\" said the cat. \n\nThe mouse smiled. \"I collected extra berries today on my walk. Would you like to have some?\" \n\nThe cat was confused. He had never been given such a kind thing. \"Well, OK. Berries are not my favorite, but I guess that they are OK.\" \n\nThe cat and mouse then sat down together and ate a meal of tasty berries. It turned out that the cat was not so terrible after all-but had never been given kindness.\n'Question': What color was the cat?\n'Answer: 'Grey'\n\n'Question': What was the cat's name?\n'Answer: 'The cat's name was not mentioned.\n\n'Question': What was the cat's favorite food?\n'Answer: 'The cat's favorite food was not mentioned.\n\n'",
