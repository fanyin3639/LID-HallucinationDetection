You may have been free, you loved living your lie, fate had its own scheme, crushed like a bug you still die,\" Israel Keyes wrote. \n\nKeyes killed himself in December.

Koenig was one of at least eight people Keyes admitted to killing, but he may have taken other lives, police have said. \n\nKeyes' notes were released by the FBI on Wednesday after they were cleaned up at the bureau's lab in Quantico, Virginia.

It said an analysis showed no hidden messages or code in the four pages. \n\nBut a read of them does give a glimpse into Keyes' mind, apparently describing how it felt to take a life and the disdain in which he held much of American society. \n\n\"I looked in your eyes, they were so dark, warm and trusting as though you had not a worry or care.
