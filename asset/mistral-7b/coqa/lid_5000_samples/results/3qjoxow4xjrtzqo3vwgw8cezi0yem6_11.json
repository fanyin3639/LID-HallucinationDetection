A lot of us standing outside. \n\nSuddenly came a dull, crashing sound from the school-room. At the ominous interruption I shuddered involuntarily, and called to Smithsye:-- \n\n\"What's up, Smithums?\" \n\n\"Guy's cleaning out the fourth form,\" he replied. \n\nAt the same moment George de Coverly passed me, holding his nose, from whence the bright Norman blood streamed redly.

His eyes were glittering but pitiless. There was a sternness about the lower part of his face,--the old Heavystone look,--a sternness, heightened, perhaps, by the snaffle-bit which, in one of his strange freaks, he wore in his mouth to curb his occasional ferocity. His dress was well adapted to his square-set and herculean frame. A striped knit undershirt, close-fitting striped tights, and a few spangles set off his figure; a neat Glengarry cap adorned his head. On it was displayed the Heavystone crest, a cock regardant on a dunghill or, and the motto, \"Devil a better!\" \n'Question': How did he explain the noise?\n'Answer: 'It was the noise of a steam-engine.'\n\n\"What are you doing, Guy?\" I asked. \n\n\"Cleaning out the fourth form,\" he replied, \"and making a new one.\" \n\n\"What are you going to do with the old one?\" \n\n\"I",
