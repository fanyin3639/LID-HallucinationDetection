In many ways that helps you because you can keep going without being limited.\" \n\nAmla batted for just over 13 hours and hit 35 fours, including a boundary off Tim Bresnan when on 299, lofting it over the infield before taking a prolonged standing ovation from the crowd. \n\nThey had seen England's much-vaunted bowling attack blunted on a docile pitch with Kallis reaching his 43rd Test ton in tandem. \n'Question': In what sports?\n'Answer: 'Cricket'\n\nContext: (CNN) -- Hashim Amla became the first South African to score a triple century in Test cricket as his side dominated No.1 ranked England at The Oval Sunday. \n\nAmla was 311 not out as South Africa declared on",
