There had been some talk of going to the opera afterwards, but no one seemed to care about it, and so it dropped through. \n\n\"For my part,\" Lady Thurwell said, as they sat lingering over their dessert, \"I shall quite enjoy an evening's rest. You literary men, Mr. Maddison, talk a good deal about being overworked, but you know nothing of the life of a chaperon in the season. I tell Helen that she is sadly wanting in gratitude. We do everything worth doing--picture galleries, matin\u00e9es, shopping, afternoon calls, dinners, dances, receptions--why, there's no slavery like it.\" \n\nHelen laughed softly. \n\n\"We do a great deal too much, aunt,\" she said. \"I am almost coming round to my father's opinion.

That is why one meets so few who interest one, as a rule. Don't you think all this society life very frivolous, Mr. Maddison?\" \n\n\"I am not willing to be its judge,\" he answered. \"Yet it is a moral axiom that the higher we seek for our pleasures the greater happiness we attain to. I am an uncompromising enemy to what is known as fashionable society, so I will draw no conclusions.\" \n'Question': In what capacity is she acting for the dinner?\n'Answer: 'Lady Thurwell is acting as a chaperone for Helen.\n\n'Question: 'Why does she say that Helen is \"wanting in gratitude\"?\n'Answer: 'She says this because Helen does not seem to appreciate the efforts that Lady Thurwell is making to entertain her.\n",
