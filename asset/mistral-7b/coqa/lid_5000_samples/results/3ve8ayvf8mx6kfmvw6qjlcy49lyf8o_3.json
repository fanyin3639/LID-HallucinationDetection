        "Answer the following questions:\nContext: CHAPTER XI Peter Rabbit and Jerry Muskrat Are Puzzled. \n\nJerry Muskrat was more and more sure that his big cousin, Paddy the Beaver, didn't know quite so much as he might about house-building. Jerry would have liked to offer some suggestions, but he didn't quite dare. You see, he was very anxious not to displease his big cousin. But he felt that he simply had got to speak his mind to someone, so he swam across to where he had seen Peter Rabbit almost every night since Paddy began to build. Sure enough, Peter was there, sitting up very straight and staring with big round eyes at the platform of mud and sticks out in the water where Paddy the Beaver was at work. \n\n\"Well, Peter, what do you think of it?\" asked Jerry \n\n\"What is it?\" asked Peter innocently. \"Is it another dam?\" \n\nJerry threw back his head and laughed and laughed. \n\nPeter looked at him suspiciously. \"I don't see anything to laugh at,\" said he. \n\n\"Why, it's a house, you stupid. It's Paddy's new house,\" replied Jerry, wiping the tears of laughter from his eyes. \n\n\"I'm not stupid!\" retorted Peter. \"How was I to know that that pile of mud and sticks is meant for a house? It certainly doesn't look it. Where is the door?\" \n\n\"To tell you the truth, I don't think it is much of a house myself,\" replied Jerry. \"It has got a door, all right. In fact it has got three. You can't see them because they are under water, and there is a passage from each right up through that platform of mud and sticks, which is the foundation of the house. It really is a very fine foundation, Peter; it really is. But what I can't understand is what Paddy is thinking of by building that great pile of mud right in the middle. When he gets his walls built, where will his bedroom be? There won't be any room at all. It won't be a house at all--just a big useless pile of sticks and mud. \n'Question': What did the annoyed boy this is was at first?\n'Answer: 'The boy was annoyed at being asked to help with the work.\n'Question': What did the boy do when he was asked to help with the work?\n'Answer: 'The boy ran away.\n'Question': What did the boy say when he was asked to help with the work?\n",
