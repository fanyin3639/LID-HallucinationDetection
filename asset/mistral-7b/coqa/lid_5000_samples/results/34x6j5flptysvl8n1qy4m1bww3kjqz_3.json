        "Answer the following questions:\nContext: Once upon a time, there was a squirrel named Joey. Joey loved to go outside and play with his cousin Jimmy. Joey and Jimmy played silly games together, and were always laughing. One day, Joey and Jimmy went swimming together at their Aunt Julie's pond. Joey woke up early in the morning to eat some food before they left. He couldn't find anything to eat except for pie! Usually, Joey would eat cereal, fruit (a pear), or oatmeal for breakfast. After he ate, he and Jimmy went to the pond. On their way there they saw their friend Jack Rabbit. They dove into the water and swam for several hours. The sun was out, but the breeze was cold. Joey and Jimmy got out of the water and started walking home. Their fur was wet, and the breeze chilled them. When they got home, they dried off, and Jimmy put on his favorite purple shirt. Joey put on a blue shirt with red and green dots. The two squirrels ate some food that Joey's mom, Jasmine, made and went off to bed.\n'Question': Where did they go?\n'Answer: 'They went to the pond.\n'Question': What did they eat?\n'Answer: 'They ate pie.\n'Question': What color was Jimmy's shirt?\n'Answer: 'Purple.\n'Question': What color was Joey's shirt?\n'An",
