They brush their teeth until they twinkle. They hide in the bushes and play games. There is one game they really like. To play, one chipmunk puts his ear on the phone, and another hides in the woods with a different phone. One chipmunk walks through the woods looking for the hiding chipmunk. The hiding chipmunk tells 'hot' or 'cold' to the first one on the phone. If 'hot', he is very close to finding! If 'cold', he's very far away! Chipmunks love to be hot, so there is a twist to this game! These magical chipmunks can change the temperature with their voice, so if the hiding chipmunk says cold, all the chipmunks becomes colder. If the hiding chipmunk says 'hot', all the chipmunks become hotter. Oh, how the chipmunks love to play this game!
