Mary and Steve laughed with joy and had great fun riding the toy boat. \n\nSoon, they reached the other side of the lake. Many people were having fun swimming and splashing in the water. Steve and Mary loved seeing all the new things and people. \n\nA man threw a ball into the water. It landed by the toy boat. The man's big dog came splashing into the water to fetch it. The big waves splashed the little boat every which way! Mary and Steve got very wet. \n\nMary and Steve went back home after that.
