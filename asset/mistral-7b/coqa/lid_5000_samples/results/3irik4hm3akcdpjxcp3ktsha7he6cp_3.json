Yet not all Labs are the same. \n\nJohn Grogan discovered _ after he and his wife adopted a Labrador that they named Marley. The dog caused Mr. Grogan a lot of trouble, but it also provided many stories for his newspaper articles. Later, he wrote a best-selling book, \"Marley and Me: Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog.\" \n\nMarley was happy and fun-loving. But he was also extremely large and difficult to control. He bit anything that he could find around the house, including plastic, clothing and jewelry. And he had a great fear of loud noises, especially thunderstorms. Unfortunately, the Grogans lived in Florida where many thunderstorms develop. Marley would attack the furniture, walls and doors until his feet bled if he was left alone in the house during a thunderstorm. Marley almost damaged their home several times. \n\nJohn Grogan said that at first he considered that probably his dog could be trained to be a show champion. But he soon realized that was impossible. Marley didn't like to learn skills that didn't belong to dogs, and he was driven out of the dog training school for causing troubles for other dogs. He didn't want to hide his emotions. He would show his anger and tiredness if he felt them. \n\nEven if that, Marley still had earned a place in the Grogans'. He didn't know how to dance, and he didn't know how to walk on its two legs, but he was what he was. He would never be a Lassie or a Benji or an old Yeller for he would never like to take part in a dog show, but the Grogans accepted him and loved him very much.\n'Question': What breed?\n'Answer: 'Labrador\n'Question': What is Marley's character?\n'Answer: 'Gentle, clever and friendly\n'Question': What does the writer say about Marley?\n'Answer: 'He was happy and fun-loving.
