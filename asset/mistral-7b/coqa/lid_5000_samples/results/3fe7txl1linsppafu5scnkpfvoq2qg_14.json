        "Answer the following questions:\nContext: The Arena Football League (AFL) is the highest level of professional indoor American football in the United States. It was founded in 1987 by Jim Foster, making it the third longest-running professional football league in North America, after the Canadian Football League and the National Football League. It is played indoors on a 68-yard field (about half the distance of an NFL field), resulting in a faster-paced and higher-scoring game. The sport was invented in the early 1980s and patented by Foster, a former executive of the United States Football League and the National Football League. \n\nFor its 2015 season, the league consisted of 12 teams, all from the United States; however, upon the completion of the regular season, the league announced that the two teams it had assumed operation of during the season would cease all operations effective immediately; a regular season game slated between the two had previously been canceled and declared a tie. Subsequently, one of the remaining teams, the Spokane Shock, severed its ties with the league to join the competing IFL. The AFL is divided into two conferences \u2013 the American Conference and National Conference. Starting 2016, each conference will have only four teams as the champion San Jose SaberCats announced in November 2015 that they were ceasing activity for \"reasons not associated with League operations.\"\n'Question': Are teams leaving them?\n'Answer: 'Yes'\n'Question: 'Why?\n'Answer: 'Because of the league's financial troubles.'\n'Question: 'Is the league financially troubled?'\n'Answer: 'Yes'\n'Question: 'Is the league in trouble?'\n'Answer: 'Yes'",
