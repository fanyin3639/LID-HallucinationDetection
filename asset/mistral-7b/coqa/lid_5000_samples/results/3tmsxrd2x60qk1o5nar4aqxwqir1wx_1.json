        "Answer the following questions:\nContext: CHAPTER V. \n\nTHE FITZGERALDS OF CASTLE RICHMOND. \n\nWhat idea of carrying out his plans may have been prevalent in Fitzgerald's mind when he was so defiant of the countess, it may be difficult to say. Probably he had no idea, but felt at the spur of the moment that it would be weak to yield. The consequence was, that when Lady Desmond left Hap House, he was obliged to consider himself as being at feud with the family. \n\nThe young lord he did see once again during the holidays, and even entertained him at Hap House; but the earl's pride would not give way an inch. \n\n\"Much as I like you, Owen, I cannot do anything but oppose it. It would be a bad match for my sister, and so you'd feel if you were in my place.\" And then Lord Desmond went back to Eton. \n\nAfter that they none of them met for many months. During this time life went on in a very triste manner at Desmond Court. Lady Desmond felt that she had done her duty by her daughter; but her tenderness to Clara was not increased by the fact that her foolish attachment had driven Fitzgerald from the place. As for Clara herself, she not only kept her word, but rigidly resolved to keep it. Twice she returned unopened, and without a word of notice, letters which Owen had caused to be conveyed to her hand. It was not that she had ceased to love him, but she had high ideas of truth and honour, and would not break her word. Perhaps she was sustained in her misery by the remembrance that heroines are always miserable. \n'Question': Who is thinking about a plan?\n'Answer: ' Fitzgerald is thinking about a plan.\n'Question': What is the plan?\n'Answer: ' He is thinking about a plan to get back at the Countess.\n'Question': What does the Countess do?\n'Answer: ' She leaves Hap House.\n'Question",
