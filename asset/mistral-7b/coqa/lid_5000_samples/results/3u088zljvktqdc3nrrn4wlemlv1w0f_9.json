She had made them a picnic lunch, including sandwiches, fruit and potato chips. As they looked around the park, they watched the other families play and eat lunch. There was one family that had 3 dogs with them. The dogs were chasing each other and playing Frisbee with their people. Another family had a big blanket set out and were watching their baby learn to crawl on his tummy. Anthony asked his sister if she wanted the rest of his potato chips. Michelle said no, that she was full. They got up and went over to the family with the dogs. The white dog jumped on Michelle and licked her face, knocking her down. The brown dog wagged his tail and sniffed Anthony. The black dog was shy and went to sit with his family. After they said goodbye to the dogs, Michelle and Anthony saw their friends Mike and Molly across the park. They asked their mom if they could go play with them and she said yes. They ran to their friends and told them about the dogs they had met. Mike and Molly's mom gave Michelle and Anthony some strawberry ice cream for dessert. They thanked her, and when they finished, they went back to their mom, ready to go home and take a nap.\n'Question': Did they have dessert?\n'Answer: 'Yes'\n'Question': Did they have lunch?\n'Answer: 'Yes'\n'Question': Did they have dinner?\n'Answer: 'No'\n'Question': Did they have breakfast?\n'Answer: 'No'\n'Question': Did they have a snack?",
