But these days, the hunter has become the hunted, because of better methods from commercial fishermen who are looking for fins to make expensive soup sold mostly in Asia. Shark fins are far more valuable than shark meat, so fishermen cut the fins off live fish and throw the sharks overboard to maximize the catch they bring back. \n\nShark finning is illegal in the United States, but there're tournament sport fishermen, who target and kill the biggest ones they take from the sea. These tournaments, the prizes of which can reach $5,000 or more, attract large crowds of anglers but also draw protests from animal rights groups and environmentalists. \n\nThe competitors say they are enjoying a fun and legal sport, the impact on the overall shark population is very small, and most of the sharks caught are returned to the ocean. Dave Johnson, who is from Kennebunkport, Maine, said no one ever comes close to the limit set by the government of killing one shark per day during the three-month season. \n\n\"I enjoy watching these animals, but I also enjoy catching and releasing them, and very rarely killing them and eating them,\" he said. \"If I thought killing one shark was endangering the species and contributing to their decline I'd stop doing it tomorrow.\" \n\nThat is exactly what marine biologists like Luke Tipple want to happen. \"I believe that they should just stop it.
