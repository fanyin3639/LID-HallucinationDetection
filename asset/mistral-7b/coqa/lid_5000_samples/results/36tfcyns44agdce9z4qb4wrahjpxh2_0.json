        "Answer the following questions:\nContext: CHAPTER LXXI. \n\nSHEWING WHAT HUGH STANBURY THOUGHT ABOUT THE DUTY OF MAN. \n\nIn the conference which took place between Sir Marmaduke and his wife after the interview between him and Nora, it was his idea that nothing further should be done at all. \"I don't suppose the man will come here if he be told not,\" said Sir Marmaduke, \"and if he does, Nora of course will not see him.\" He then suggested that Nora would of course go back with them to the Mandarins, and that when once there she would not be able to see Stanbury any more. \"There must be no correspondence or anything of that sort, and so the thing will die away.\" But Lady Rowley declared that this would not quite suffice. Mr. Stanbury had made his offer in due form, and must be held to be entitled to an answer. Sir Marmaduke, therefore, wrote the following letter to the \"penny-a-liner,\" mitigating the asperity of his language in compliance with his wife's counsels. \n\nManchester Street, April 20th, 186--. \n\nMY DEAR SIR,-- \n\nLady Rowley has told me of your proposal to my daughter Nora; and she has told me also what she learned from you as to your circumstances in life. I need hardly point out to you that no father would be justified in giving his daughter to a gentleman upon so small an income, and upon an income so very insecure. \n\nI am obliged to refuse my consent, and I must therefore ask you to abstain from visiting and from communicating with my daughter. \n'Question': Who did Sir Marmaduke have a conference with?\n'Answer: 'He had a conference with his wife.\n\n'Question': What was Sir Marmaduke's idea about the duty of man?\n'Answer: He thought that nothing further should be done at all.\n\n'Question': What did Sir Marmaduke suggest?\n'Answer:",
