Of course, if we did it at night he might become suspicious.\" \n\n\"Say, do you fellows know that it's five minutes to twelve?\" questioned Andy, after consulting his watch. \"I move that we keep our eyes open for some place where we can take it easy and have lunch.\" \n\n\"And I second the commotion,\" returned his brother, joking in a way their father had made familiar to them. \n\nThe boys rode on for half an hour longer, and then reached the top of the hill they were ascending.
