Giordano told authorities the two were snorkeling on August 2 when he signaled to Gardner to swim back.

I was busy saving my life.\" \n\nAruban judges repeatedly granted requests to extend Giordano's detention, while the investigation continued. But last week, a judge rejected prosecutors' request to hold Giordano, of Gaithersburg, Maryland, for an additional 30 days. He was released Tuesday. \n\nA three-judge panel of Aruban judges held a hearing Wednesday to review the decision to release Giordano, but upheld it. ABC aired a clip of an emotional Giordano learning of the decision at the airport. \"I'd accepted the fact that they were going to keep me from my kids forever,\" he told reporters in the video. \n'Question': Why?\n'Answer: 'I have no idea.'\n\n\"I'm not a suspect. I'm not a person of interest. I'm a person who has been accused of a crime that I didn't commit,\" he said. \"I'm not a murderer. I'm not a kidnapper.",
