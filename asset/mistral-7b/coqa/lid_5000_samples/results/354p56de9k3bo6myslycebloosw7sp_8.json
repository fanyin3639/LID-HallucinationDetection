In particular, these changes included a touch-optimized Windows shell based on Microsoft's \"Metro\" design language, the Start screen (which displays programs and dynamically updated content on a grid of tiles), a new platform for developing apps with an emphasis on touchscreen input, integration with online services (including the ability to sync apps and settings between devices), and Windows Store, an online store for downloading and purchasing new software. Windows 8 added support for USB 3.0, Advanced Format hard drives, near field communications, and cloud computing. Additional security features were introduced, such as built-in antivirus software, integration with Microsoft SmartScreen phishing filtering service and support for UEFI Secure Boot on supported devices with UEFI firmware, to prevent malware from infecting the boot process.\n'Question': how many Additional security features were introduced ?\n'Answer: '2'\n'Question': what is the name of the online store for downloading and purchasing new software ?\n'Answer: 'Windows Store'\n'Question': what is the name of the touch-optimized Windows shell based on Microsoft's \"Metro\" design language ?\n'Answer:",
