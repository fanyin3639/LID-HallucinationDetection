        "Answer the following questions:\nContext: Jessica went to sit in her rocking chair. Today was her birthday and she was turning 80. Her granddaughter Annie was coming over in the afternoon and Jessica was very excited to see her. Her daughter Melanie and Melanie's husband Josh were coming as well. Jessica had a lot to do before they got here, but she was very tired. After taking a nap for half an hour Jessica got up and walked to the drier. She moved the dry clothes into a basket. Next, she took the clothes out of the washer and put them into the drier. She pressed the button on the drier to get it started then walked back out of the room. She also needed to feed her duck. The chickens in her backyard did not need to be fed as they belonged to her neighbor. Jack the dog had been fed earlier that morning and Becky the cat always had food in her bowl. After Jessica finished feeding the duck she came inside and heard the telephone ringing. She answered the phone to hear Annie's excited voice say \"Happy birthday grandma!\" Annie said they would be over very soon. Jessica smiled because she loved her family more than anything. She was very excited. She sat back on her rocking chair and waited until her family arrived.\n'Question': How many?\n'Answer: ' 2\n'Question': How many?\n'Answer: ' 1\n'Question': How many?\n'Answer: ' 1\n'Question': How many?\n'Answer: ' 1\n'Question': How many?\n'Answer: ' 2\n'",
