        "Answer the following questions:\nContext: A new study suggests that early exposure to germs strengthens the immune system. That means letting children get a little dirty might be good for their health later in life. \n\nThe study involved laboratory mice. It found that adult mice raised in a germ-free environment were more likely to develop allergies, asthma and other autoimmune disorders. There are more than eighty disorders where cells that normally defend the body instead attack tissues and organs. \n\nRichard Blumberg,who led the study,is a professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston,Massachusetts. He says,in 1989,medical researchers who sought to explain these diseases, first discovered that the increasing use of antibacterial soaps and other products, especially early in life, could weaken immune systems. \n\nNow, Dr. Blumberg and his team have what is the first biological evidence to link early exposure to germs to stronger adult immune systems. They say this exposure could prevent the development of some autoimmune diseases. \n\nIn the adult germ-free mice, they found that inflammation in the lungs and colon was caused by so-called killer T cells. These normally fight infection. But they became overactive and targeted healthy tissue--an autoimmune condition seen in asthma and a disease called ulcerative colitis . \n\nDr. Blumberg says the mice raised in a normal environment did not have the same reaction. He says their immune systems had been \"educated\" by early exposure to germs. \n\nRates of autoimmune disorders are rising worldwide, but mostly in wealthier, industrialized countries. According to Dr. Blumberg, it might be high time that people were warned to be more careful with the early use of antibiotics and the prescription from their doctors. \n\nRob Dunn is a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. He says the new study does not mean people should stop washing. \"Wash your hands , but don't do it with antibacterial soap. Let your kids play in a reasonable amount of dirt and get outside and get exposed to a diversity of things\", says Rob Dunn.\n'Question': and what else?\n'Answer: '\n'Question': and what else?\n'Answer: '\n'Question': and what else?\n'Answer: '\n'Question': and what else?\n'Answer: '\n'Question': and what else?\n'Answer: '\n'Question': and what else?",
