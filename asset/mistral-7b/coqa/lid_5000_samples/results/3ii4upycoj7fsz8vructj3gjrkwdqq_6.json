There could get mud out of the pond but that would be too soft and splat when they hit it with the wooden bat. Finally Bob, being the tallest, saw that in a pile of plants that there were melons growing. \"Let's use a melon,\" Bob said. \"That's stupid,\" said Shelly, the practical one. \"No hear him out,\" said Lucy. \"It might work. \"It'll work,\" said Bob, and he picked a melon and handed it to Shelly. \"You pitch.\" \"This is going to end badly, I'm afraid,\" Shelly said, throwing the melon at Bob who stood over home plate. \"I know what I'm doing,\" Bob said, swinging the bat as hard as he could.
