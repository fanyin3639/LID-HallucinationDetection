The extreme opposite of endemism is cosmopolitan distribution. An alternative term for a species that is endemic is precinctive, which applies to species (and subspecific categories) that are restricted to a defined geographical area. \n\nThe word \"endemic\" is from New Latin \"end\u0113micus\", from Greek \u03b5\u03bd\u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, \"end\u0113mos\", \"native\". \"End\u0113mos\" is formed of \"en\" meaning \"in\", and \"d\u0113mos\" meaning \"the people\".
