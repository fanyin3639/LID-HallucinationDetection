Except in the river valleys, trees of any size are scarce on the prairie, but the slender trunks and leafless branches were closely massed and afforded a little shelter.

I expect he'll cut out our place and make straight for Grant's. We'll have snow before long.\" \n\nThere was an empty shack not far away where, by George's consent, the mail-carrier left letters when bad weather made it desirable to shorten his round. \n\nGrierson nodded as he glanced about. The stretch of desolate white prairie had contracted since he had last noticed it, the surrounding dimness was creeping nearer in, and the ranks of poplar trunks were losing their sharpness of form.
