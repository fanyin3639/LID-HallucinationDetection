He wanted chicken or cold cuts or left over meat loaf, but his mom sent Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwiches. The best way to get to the river was along the path. When the path ended, they needed to go through the bushes to the river. On some days they would think about going another way. They could go over the bridge, or through the back of the house or through Uncle Tom's yard. Today they took the path to the river. Andrew found some animal poop along the path. He asked his Grandpa what kind of animal poop he had found. He wanted to know if it was a lion, a tiger or a bear that had made the poop. Grandpa pointed in the bushes. Andrew saw a small black and white animal looking at him with big eyes. Andrew knew that he had was looking at a raccoon. He was sure that the raccoon had made the poop. When Andrew and Grandpa got to the river they put their fishing poles into the water. Andrew caught his first fish right away. He caught a second fish before lunch. He got hungry and had his Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwich and cool water. He saw that Grandpa had fallen asleep. After eating his lunch, Andrew caught three more fish before he woke up his grandpa. When Andrew and Grandpa got back home they gave all the fish they had caught to Andrew's mother, so she could make a good dinner.\n'Question': What was Andrew waiting for?\n'Answer: 'Andrew was waiting for his granddaddy to show up.\n'Question': What did his mom pack them for lunch?\n'Answer: 'His mom had packed them a lunch.
