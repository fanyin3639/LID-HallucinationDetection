        "Answer the following questions:\nContext: There once was a wolf that liked to scare the other forest animals. By daylight he pretended to be a kind, nice wolf. By night, he would circle the forest and hunt down his food. When he was very hungry, he would find humans and woof like a dog in hopes that someone would feed him. The wolf's favorite food was meat seasoned with lemon. The wolf liked to watch his food run in circles like a hamster until he felt like eating it. Sometimes the wolf would stay in the sand and lay in the sun until he would crawl back to his home and fall asleep with a full stomach. On other days, he goes home hungry. Sometimes there would be a knock on his door, and the wolf would be pleased because it meant his dinner had come to him and he would not have to hunt that day. Those days were the best for the wolf, by far.\n'Question': DOes he sometimes go home hungry?\n'Answer: 'Yes, he does.\n'Question': Does he sometimes have to hunt for his food?\n'Answer: 'Yes, he does.\n'Question': Does he like to hunt for his food?\n'Answer: 'No, he does not.\n'Question': Does he like to eat",
