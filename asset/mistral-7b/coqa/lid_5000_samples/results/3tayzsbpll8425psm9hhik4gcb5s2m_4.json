He infected the others. Erik gave an imitation of the Greek dancers he had seen in vaudeville, and when they sat down to picnic supper spread on a lap-robe on the grass, Cy climbed a tree to throw acorns at them. \n'Question': whose idea was the picnic?\n'Answer: 'Fern Mullins\n\n'Question': what is the meaning of the word 'dandy' in the context of the above passage?\n'Answer: 'a person who is very fashionable\n\n'Question': who is Erik Valborg?\n'Answer: 'a Swedish immigrant\n\n",
