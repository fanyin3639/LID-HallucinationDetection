        "Answer the following questions:\nContext: A social class (or, simply, class), as in class society, is a set of subjectively defined concepts in the social sciences and political theory centered on models of social stratification in which people are grouped into a set of hierarchical social categories, the most common being the upper, middle, and lower classes. \n\nClass is a subject of analysis for sociologists, political scientists, anthropologists, and social historians. However, there is not a consensus on a definition of \"class\", and the term has a wide range of sometimes conflicting meanings. In common parlance, the term \"social class\" is usually synonymous with \"socio-economic class\", defined as \"people having the same social, economic, cultural, political or educational status\", e.g., \"the working class\"; \"an emerging professional class\".
