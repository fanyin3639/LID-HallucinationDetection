Rick went to the woman in danger of drowning,while Mary held fast on to the other one and pulled her up on the beach.\"Then I went back to help Rick,\" Mary says.\"The sand dropped off steeply,and a riptide was beating the woman under. She was completely helpless.\" \n\nNot getting well from recent knee surgery,the woman had been unable to turn over or push herself up.\"Her friend had been in danger too,\" Mary says.\"The waves were pushing her around. There's no way she could have held on much longer.\" \n\nThe women hadn't called out for help. \"They were struggling so hard that there was no time for screaming,\" Mary recalls.\"But ChiChi had sensed their danger.\" \n\nDuty done,ChiChi was back in his chair,asleep,by the time the two women were on dry ground and the Lanes had returned to their blankets.Luckily,the women were fine,though shaken.They thanked the Lanes for saving their lives. \n\nBack home in Greensboro,North Carolina,the Lanes ordered a special collar with the words \"Hero Dog\" on it.\n'Question': What?\n'Answer: 'What is the lesson we can learn from this story?'\n\nI'm not sure if I'm doing this right.",
