At least she should hear whether _Macbeth_, at the Princess's Theatre, fulfilled Mr. Randolf's conceptions of it; and if Mr. Currie approved his grand map of the Newcastle district, with the little trees that she had taught him to draw. \n'Question': Where was she going next?\n'Answer: 'To the Princess's Theatre.'\n\n'Question: 'What did she think of _Macbeth_?'\n'Answer: 'It was not so good as _Hamlet_.'\n\n'Question: 'Did she like it?'\n'Answer: 'She did not like it",
