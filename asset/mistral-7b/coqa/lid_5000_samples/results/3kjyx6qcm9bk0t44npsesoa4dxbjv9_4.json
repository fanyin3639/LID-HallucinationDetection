Luna hoped that her friends could help her find some socks. She flew to the old maple tree where Olive the owl lived. \n\n\"Olive, may I please borrow a pair of your socks?\" she asked. \n\nOlive the owl looked surprised. \"Luna, I have no use for socks because my legs and toes have thick feathers. Go visit one of the animals that walk on four legs. They might have extra socks you could borrow.\" \n\nLuna flew across the field and landed next to the icy creek. Rose the raccoon was teaching her six babies how to wash their paws. The water was very cold, but the babies were having fun. \n\n\"Rose, my bare legs and bare toes are so cold, may I please borrow a pair of your socks?\" begged Luna. \n\nRose laughed hard. \"Silly Luna, I do not have socks. Look at my legs and feet. They are covered with thick, warm fur. I'm sorry I cannot help you. Go visit the humans. Sometimes I tip over their garbage cans at night when I am looking for food. Once I saw a pair of socks.\" \n\nLuna was very afraid of humans. Her grandmother and mother had warned her about them. She was told that some humans are mean and hurt hawks. Her feet were so cold that it was difficult to grip tree branches. She became brave. She flew to the farmhouse on the big hill. When she landed on the roof, she could not believe her eyes. She saw socks! In late autumn, Henrietta the human had put laundry outside to dry and she had forgotten to bring in one tiny pair of socks. The socks were hanging on the clothesline by two wooden pins. Luna used her powerful beak to break the pins. She put on the socks and then flew back to her home in the huge tree. When she landed, her feet were warm and dry. Luna was very happy.\n'Question': Did she have socks?\n'Answer: 'No, she did not have socks.'\n\n'Question': Did she have socks?\n'Answer: 'No, she did not have socks.'\n\n'Question': Did she have socks?\n'Answer: 'No, she did not have socks.'\n\n'Question': Did she have",
