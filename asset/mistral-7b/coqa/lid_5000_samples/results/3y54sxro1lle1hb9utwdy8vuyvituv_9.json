        "Answer the following questions:\nContext: (CNN) -- Smart, successful, funny and handsome. Robin Williams seemed to have it all. And yet, today he is dead. Apparently, by his own choice. \n\nBut why? What went wrong? \n\nThe joy, spontaneity and humor of Robin Williams likely masked the daily torment he endured in his on-again-off-again struggle with depression. He made us laugh out here, but he was in pain in there. Unfortunately, I know that pain. \n\nIn his death, we have lost one of the most talented and creative spirits on the planet.
