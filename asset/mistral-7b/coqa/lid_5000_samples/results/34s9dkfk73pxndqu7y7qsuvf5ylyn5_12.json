Will the beauty school student from Australia's Gold Coast be found guilty of smuggling a large bag of marijuana into Indonesia -- where the maximum penalty for drug trafficking is death by firing squad? \n\nA furrow forms between the 27-year-old's eyebrows as the judge reads out the verdict in Bahasa Indonesia. \n\nCorby appears confused. Her piercing blue eyes dart around the room -- at her family, at the cameras broadcasting live to televisions around Australia, at the ground, at her interpreter. Then reality sets in. \n\nGuilty -- the judge said. Her sentence? Twenty years in a Bali prison. \n\nAt the back of the court, members of her family erupt with anger. \n\n\"It's not alright! How dare you?\" screams her sister, Mercedes. \n\n\"We swore on the Bible to tell the truth and your fellow lied!\" her mother, Rosleigh Rose, booms at the prosecutors. \n\nAs her daughter is led away, Rose makes a promise: \"Schapelle, you will come home. Our government will bring you home.\" \n\nNot since Lindy Chamberlain claimed a dingo took her baby in the Outback have Australians become so caught up in a courtroom drama. Nearly nine years on from the verdict, interest remains strong enough to sustain a soon-to-be-broadcast Australian telemovie based on the case. \n\nAnd now Corby has walked out of prison -- on parole but free. Yet Australia remains divided as to whether she is guilty of the crime. \n'Question': What's her mom's name?\n'Answer: 'Rosleigh Rose'\n'Question: What's her sister's name?\n'Answer: 'Mercedes'\n'Question: What's her brother's name?\n'Answer: 'Michael'\n'Question: What's her dad's name?\n",
