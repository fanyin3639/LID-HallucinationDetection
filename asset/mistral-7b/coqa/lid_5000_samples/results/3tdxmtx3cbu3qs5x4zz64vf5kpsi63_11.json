If I had to do it over again, I'd do it in a minute,\" Dick Cheney says in \"The World According to Dick Cheney,\" which debuts at 9 p.m. ET on Showtime. \n\nThe two-hour documentary tells the story of Cheney's life through his own comments, supplemented by a narrator and interviews with journalists, biographers, former aides and his longtime friend and mentor Donald Rumsfeld, the former secretary of Defense. \n\nWhile the film covers Cheney's unprecedented and controversial role as vice president, the first half of the film explores the surprising tale of his rise from a two-time Yale dropout with two drunk-driving arrests to the man who once stood behind the leader of the free world. \n\nIn \"The World According to Dick Cheney,\" produced by R.J.
