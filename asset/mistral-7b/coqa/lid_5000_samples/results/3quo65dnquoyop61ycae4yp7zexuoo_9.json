Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as the gene\u2013environment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye colour or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life. \n\nGenes can acquire mutations in their sequence, leading to different variants, known as alleles, in the population. These alleles encode slightly different versions of a protein, which cause different phenotype traits. Colloquial usage of the term \"having a gene\" (e.g., \"good genes,\" \"hair colour gene\") typically refers to having a different allele of the gene.
