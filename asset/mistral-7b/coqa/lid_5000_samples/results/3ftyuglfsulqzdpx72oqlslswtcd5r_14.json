There was a knock at the door, and Cynthia opened it to discover a colored hall-boy with a roll in his hand. \n\n\"Mistah Ephum Prescott?\" he said. \n\n\"Yes,\" answered Ephraim, \"that's me.\" \n\nCynthia shut the door and gave him the roll, but Ephraim took it as though he were afraid of its contents. \n\n\"Guess it's some of them war records from Amasy,\" he said. \n\n\"Oh, Cousin Eph,\" exclaimed Cynthia, excitedly, \"why don't you open it?

Curiously enough, she ran into Jethro in the hall immediately outside of Ephraim's door. Ephraim got to his feet; it was very difficult for him to realize that his troubles were ended, that he was to earn his living at last. He looked at Jethro, and his eyes filled with tears. \"I guess I can't thank you as I'd ought to, Jethro,\" he said, \"leastways, not now.\" \n'Question': what happened?\n'Answer: 'Ephraim was appointed postmaster of Brampton.\n\n'Question': Why did Ephraim look at Jethro?\n'Answer: Because he wanted to thank him.\n\n'Question': What did Ephraim say to Jethro?\n'Answer: He",
