This was a lonely old cat that spent most of his time bullying other small animals that lived in the woods. Almost all of the other little animals who lived in the woods knew of the old cat, and warned everyone they knew to stay away from him. \n\nOne day a young mouse was out taking a walk to collect some berries. It was a nice day out, so the mouse chose to go down by the river to take a quick rest for a bit. When the mouse arrived at the river he found the perfect spot to rest.

Would you like to have some?\" \n\nThe cat was confused. He had never been given such a kind thing. \"Well, OK. Berries are not my favorite, but I guess that they are OK.\" \n\nThe cat and mouse then sat down together and ate a meal of tasty berries. It turned out that the cat was not so terrible after all-but had never been given kindness.\n'Question': Were they large?\n'Answer: 'Yes, they were very large.\n\n'Question: 'Were they small?\n'Answer: 'No, they were not small.\n\n'Question: 'Were they medium?\n'Answer: 'No, they were not medium.\n\n'Question: 'Were they",
