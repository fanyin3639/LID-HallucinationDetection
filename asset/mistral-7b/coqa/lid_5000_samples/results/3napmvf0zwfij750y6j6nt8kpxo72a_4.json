        "Answer the following questions:\nContext: CHAPTER V \n\nThe day after the little conference at John's, Felix had indeed received the following note: \n\n\"DEAR FELIX: \n\n\"When you go down to see old Tod, why not put up with us at Becket? Any time will suit, and the car can take you over to Joyfields when you like. Give the pen a rest. Clara joins in hoping you'll come, and Mother is still here. No use, I suppose, to ask Flora. \n\n\"Yours ever, \n\n\"STANLEY.\" \n\nDuring the twenty years of his brother's sojourn there Felix had been down to Becket perhaps once a year, and latterly alone; for Flora, having accompanied him the first few times, had taken a firm stand. \n\n\"My dear,\" she said, \"I feel all body there.\" \n\nFelix had rejoined: \n\n\"No bad thing, once in a way.\" \n\nBut Flora had remained firm. Life was too short! She did not get on well with Clara. Neither did Felix feel too happy in his sister-in-law's presence; but the gray top-hat instinct had kept him going there, for one ought to keep in touch with one's brothers. \n\nHe replied to Stanley: \n\n\"DEAR STANLEY: \n\n\"Delighted; if I may bring my two youngsters. We'll arrive to-morrow at four-fifty. \n\n\"Yours affectionately, \n\n\"FELIX.\" \n\nTravelling with Nedda was always jolly; one could watch her eyes noting, inquiring, and when occasion served, have one's little finger hooked in and squeezed. Travelling with Alan was convenient, the young man having a way with railways which Felix himself had long despaired of acquiring. Neither of the children had ever been at Becket, and though Alan was seldom curious, and Nedda too curious about everything to be specially so about this, yet Felix experienced in their company the sensations of a new adventure. \n'Question': what did he get after the conference at John's?\n'Answer: 'He received a note from Stanley.\n'Question': What did Stanley say in his note?\n'Answer: 'He invited Felix to come to Becket.\n'Question': How did Felix reply to Stanley?\n'Answer: 'He said he would come with his two children.\n\n'",
