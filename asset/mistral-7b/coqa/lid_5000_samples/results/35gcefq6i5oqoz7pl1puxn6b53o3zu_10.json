It might even spark riots at movie theaters, they thought. \n\nInstead, what the film provoked was ... talk. There were no riots. Dinkins was elected. \"Do the Right Thing\" had a successful run at the box office -- if not as successful as Lee and his supporters hoped -- and was nominated for two Academy Awards. \n\nTwenty years later, the film still maintains a hold on the imagination. In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked it as one of the 100 best American films. Roger Ebert, who has written he cried when he first saw the film at the Cannes Film Festival, still considers the film a wonder: \"Spike Lee had done an almost impossible thing.

Lee's first two films, \"She's Gotta Have It\" (1986) and \"School Daze\" (1988), had marked him as a rising young filmmaker. But it was \"Do the Right Thing,\" made when Lee was just 32, that showcased his confidence, from the deliberately striking color scheme (bright reds and oranges that make a hot day seem even hotter) to its heightened -- sometimes stagy -- atmosphere, to its grim, documentary-style riot climax. \n'Question': How old was he when he made Do the Right Thing?\n'Answer: '32'\n\n'Question': What is the name of the film?\n'Answer: 'Do the Right Thing'\n\n'Question': What is the name of the character that played the pizza delivery guy?\n'Answer: 'Mookie'\n\n'Question': What is the",
