Dad told Mike to take his bicycle to the store so he could buy sugar for the cake. On his way to the store, Mike saw his friend, Sally, at the park. He rode over to say hello. Mike and Sally played lots of games at the park. After a long time, Mike saw it was starting to get dark. He needed to hurry if he was going to make it to the store and get home before night time. Mike rode as fast as he could, and made it to the store. The store was really big, but Mike found the sugar really fast. When Mike was on his way to the front of the store to pay for the sugar, he saw a toy he had been wanting for a long time. But Mike only had enough money to pay for the sugar or the toy. Mike didn't know what to do! The cake would taste good and would make his mom happy. But, the toy was so cool! Mike bought the sugar for his mom's cake, because she was always so nice to him. He could always get the toy another time. \n\n\n\n2. What did Mike find at the store that he wanted to buy\n'Question': WHat was he missing?\n'Answer: 'He was missing the sugar for the cake.\n\n\n3. Why did Mike decide to buy the sugar instead of the toy?\n'Question': Why did Mike decide to buy the sugar instead of the toy?\n'Answer: Mike decided to buy the sugar instead of the toy because he knew his mom",
