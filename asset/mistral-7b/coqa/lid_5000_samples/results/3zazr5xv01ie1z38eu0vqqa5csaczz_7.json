What should he say; or should he say anything? \n\nHe did not want to appear anxious to \"make up\" with him, nor did he want to seem as if he bore malice toward him. If he only knew how George felt about it! \n\nAs it was, he wished he had stopped somewhere on the road. He had thought of stopping at the mill--why had he not? That would just have given George time to pass. \n\nBoth boys appeared to be riding as slowly as their horses would consent to go, and yet when they met, Harry had not half made up his mind what he would say, or how he should say it, or whether it would be better or not to say anything. \n\n\"Hello, George!\" said he, quite unpremeditatedly. \n\n\"Hello!\" said George, reining in his horse \"Where are you going?\" \n\n\"Going home,\" said Harry, also stopping in the road. \n\nThus the quarrel came to an end. \n\n\"So you've sold the telegraph?\" said George. \n\n\"Yes,\" said Harry. \"And I think we made a pretty good bargain.
