        "Answer the following questions:\nContext: The National Assembly for Wales (; commonly known as the Welsh Assembly) is a devolved assembly with power to make legislation in Wales. The Assembly comprises 60 members, who are known as Assembly Members, or AMs (\"Aelodau y Cynulliad\"). Since 2011, Members are elected for five-year terms under an additional members system, in which 40 AMs represent geographical constituencies elected by the plurality system, and 20 AMs represent five electoral regions using the d'Hondt method of proportional representation. \n\nThe Assembly was created by the Government of Wales Act 1998, which followed a referendum in 1997. The Assembly had no powers to initiate primary legislation until limited law-making powers were gained through the Government of Wales Act 2006. Its primary law-making powers were enhanced following a Yes vote in the referendum on 3 March 2011, making it possible for it to legislate without having to consult the UK parliament or the Secretary of State for Wales in the 20 areas that are devolved. \n\nAn appointed Council for Wales and Monmouthshire was established in 1949 to \"ensure the government is adequately informed of the impact of government activities on the general life of the people of Wales\". The council had 27 members nominated by local authorities in Wales, the University of Wales, National Eisteddfod Council and the Welsh Tourist Board. A post of Minister of Welsh Affairs was created in 1951 and the post of Secretary of State for Wales and the Welsh Office were established in 1964 leading to the abolition of the Council for Wales. The establishment of the Welsh Office effectively created the basis for the territorial governance of Wales. The Royal Commission on the Constitution (the Kilbrandon Commission) was set up in 1969 by Harold Wilson's Labour Government to investigate the possibility of devolution for Scotland and Wales. Its recommendations formed the basis of the 1974 White Paper \"Democracy and Devolution: proposals for Scotland and Wales\", which proposed the creation of a Welsh Assembly. However, voters rejected the proposals by a majority of four to one in a referendum held in 1979.\n'Question': how many people are in it\n'Answer: '60\n'Question': what is it called\n'Answer: 'The National Assembly for Wales\n'Question': what is it called\n'Answer: 'The Welsh Assembly\n'Question': how many people are in it\n'Answer: '60\n'Question': what is it",
