        "Answer the following questions:\nContext: A boy named Eduardo in a far away place is thinking about a girl he loves. \n\nHe is cold. It is snowing where he lives. He lives in Argentina. \n\nIt's warm where she lives in Hawaii. She eats fresh fruit. Her shower is outdoors under the warm sun as red birds fly around her. It is nice, but she misses him. \n\nShe remembers he is very pretty. She wondered if he would really love her always, because she is older. \n\nHe didn't care. Eduardo was poor, so he could not visit her. \n\nMaybe a time machine would help!! She can give back her birthdays! But she didn't want to bring back any dinosaurs back by accident. Like last time. \n\nThen an angel flew down from a star called the Pleiades to help her. His name was Eh. He said, \"close your eyes! Then remember the most happy you have ever felt! Let go of any thing that feels like clouds. Imagine puppies hugging you, and kitties purring with you. Imagine you are eating chocolate ice cream! \n\nAs long as you remember how to be happy you can ALWAYS be as young as Eduardo! And you can think of GREAT ways you can see him again!\" \n\nIt worked! She had an idea. Someone in a place called MR was buying stories that people wrote. She wrote one about her & Eduardo! \n\nIt paid for her airplane ride. Wow. \n\nThen they were together again. Hugging each other in happiness, they said, \"Thank you everyone, for helping us!\"\n'Question': And then do what?\n'Answer: ' They kissed and lived happily ever after!\n\n(Please correct me if I made a mistake)",
