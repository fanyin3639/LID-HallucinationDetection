Somewhere within the silent village he was sure that the two prisoners lay. \n\nDuring the long march he had thrashed over again and again all that the success of his rash venture would mean to him. Of all those who might conceivably stand between him and the woman he loved--the woman who had just acknowledged that she loved him--these two men were the most to be feared. \n\nBilly Byrne did not for a moment believe that Anthony Harding would look with favor upon the Grand Avenue mucker as a prospective son-in-law. And then there was Mallory! He was sure that Barbara had loved this man, and now should he be restored to her as from the grave there seemed little doubt but that the old love would be aroused in the girl's breast. The truth of the matter was that Billy Byrne could not conceive the truth of the testimony of his own ears--even now he scarce dared believe that the wonderful Miss Harding loved him--him, the despised mucker! \n\nBut the depth of the man's love for the girl, and the genuineness of his new-found character were proven beyond question by the relentless severity with which he put away every thought of himself and the consequences to him in the matter he had undertaken. \n'Question': who was his prospective father in law?\n'Answer: 'Anthony Harding\n\n'Question': who was the man that Billy Byrne was sure Barbara had loved?\n'Answer: 'Mallory\n\n'Question': who was the man that Billy Byrne was sure that Barbara had loved?\n'Answer: 'Mallory",
