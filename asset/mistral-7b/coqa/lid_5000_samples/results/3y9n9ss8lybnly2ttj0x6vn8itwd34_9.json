        "Answer the following questions:\nContext: (CNN) -- With a fourth video released, Gruber-gate is now in full swing. \n\nThe latest caught-on-tape remarks from economist Jonathan Gruber, one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act, has him asserting back in 2010 that the \"American public\" -- that's you and me -- \"doesn't actually care that much about the uninsured.\" He thinks he knows us so well. \n\nIn another video released earlier, he said that to pass new health care legislation, the Obama administration successfully relied on an electorate -- again, you and me -- that didn't really understand it. \n\n\"It's a very clever, you know, basic exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the American voter,\" he tells the Honors Colloquium 2012 at the University of Rhode Island. \n\nThere appears to be a bottomless well of Gruber's greatest hits. \n\nIn yet another, from a speech at the University of Pennsylvania in 2013, he explains that the very function of the law -- doing what it was designed to do -- was totally unpalatable to voters (that is, if only we'd turned away from our Cheetos bags and NASCAR races long enough to catch it). \n\n\"If you had a law which said healthy people are going to pay in -- if you made it explicit that healthy people pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed.\" \n\nTo hammer the point home, he admits that the sales pitch was one big cover-up operation: \"Lack of transparency is a huge advantage. And basically, you know, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever. But basically that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass.\" \n'Question': the american public is who ?\n'Answer: 'the american public' is 'the american voter'",
