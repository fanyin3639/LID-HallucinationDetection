I say alone, for the pile of small boys on the floor in the corner could hardly be called company. \n\nI will try and sketch him for the reader. Guy Heavystone was then only fifteen. His broad, deep chest, his sinewy and quivering flank, his straight pastern, showed him to be a thoroughbred. Perhaps he was a trifle heavy in the fetlock, but he held his head haughtily erect. His eyes were glittering but pitiless. There was a sternness about the lower part of his face,--the old Heavystone look,--a sternness, heightened, perhaps, by the snaffle-bit which, in one of his strange freaks, he wore in his mouth to curb his occasional ferocity. His dress was well adapted to his square-set and herculean frame. A striped knit undershirt, close-fitting striped tights, and a few spangles set off his figure; a neat Glengarry cap adorned his head. On it was displayed the Heavystone crest, a cock regardant on a dunghill or, and the motto, \"Devil a better!\" \n'Question': What?\n'Answer: 'What's up, Smithums?'\n'Question': Who is Guy Heavystone?\n'Answer': He was a thoroughbred.\n'Question': What is a thoroughbred?\n'Answer': A thoroughbred is a horse that has been bred to run.\n",
