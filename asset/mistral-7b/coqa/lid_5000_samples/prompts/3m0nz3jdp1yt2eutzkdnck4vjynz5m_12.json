She will also sing with the 800-strong choir at the open-air Mass there. \n\nIn the pre-Mass program, Boyle plans to sing the hymn \"How Great Thou Art\" as well as her signature song, \"I Dreamed a Dream,\" the tune from the musical \"Les Miserables\" that shot her to fame in April 2009. \n\n\"To be able to sing for the pope is a great honor and something I've always dreamed of -- it's indescribable,\" Boyle, a Catholic, said in a statement. \"I think the 16th of September will stand out in my memory as something I've always wanted to do. I've always wanted to sing for His Holiness and I can't really put into words my happiness that this wish has come true at last.\" \n\nBoyle said her late mother was at the same Glasgow park when Pope John Paul II visited in 1982. \n\nAfter the final hymn at the end of the Mass, Boyle will sing a farewell song to the pope as he leaves to go to the airport for his flight to London, the church said. \n'Question': where is the pope flying to ?\n'Answer: '",
