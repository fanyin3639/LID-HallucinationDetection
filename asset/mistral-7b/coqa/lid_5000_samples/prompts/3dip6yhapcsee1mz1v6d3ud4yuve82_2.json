    "Answer the following questions:\nContext: Schleswig-Holstein is the northernmost of the 16 states of Germany, comprising most of the historical duchy of Holstein and the southern part of the former Duchy of Schleswig. Its capital city is Kiel; other notable cities are L\u00fcbeck and Flensburg. \n\nAlso known in more dated English as Sleswick-Holsatia, the Danish name is \"Slesvig-Holsten,\" the Low German name is \"Sleswig-Holsteen,\" and the North Frisian name is \"Slaswik-Holstiinj.\" Historically, the name can also refer to a larger region, containing both present-day Schleswig-Holstein and the former South Jutland County (Northern Schleswig) in Denmark. \n\nThe term \"Holstein\" derives from Old Saxon \"Holseta Land,\" (\"Holz\" and \"Holt\" mean wood in modern Standardised German and in literary English, respectively). Originally, it referred to the central of the three Saxon tribes north of the River Elbe: \"Tedmarsgoi\" (Dithmarschen), Holstein and \"Sturmarii\" (Stormarn). The area of the tribe of the Holsts was between the St\u00f6r River and Hamburg, and after Christianization, their main church was in Schenefeld. Saxon Holstein became a part of the Holy Roman Empire after Charlemagne's Saxon campaigns in the late eighth century. Since 811, the northern frontier of Holstein (and thus the Empire) was marked by the River Eider. \n\nThe term Schleswig comes from the city of Schleswig. The name derives from the Schlei inlet in the east and \"vik\" meaning inlet in Old Norse or settlement in Old Saxon, and linguistically identical (cognate) with the \"-wick\" or \"-wich\" element in place-names in Britain.\n'Question': Name one of the duchys it's comprised of?\n'Answer: '",
