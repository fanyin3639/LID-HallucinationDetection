She grew up at Park House, a country home leased from the royal family's Sandringham estate in Norfolk, England. Her parents, Johnnie and Frances Spencer, were well-known members of the English aristocracy. \n\nInge Crane came to Park House as an au pair when Diana was just 3 years old. \n\n\"There's always been something special about Park House. It's difficult to put a finger on what it is,\" she said in her first interview, given exclusively to CNN. \n\nLife at the house wasn't entirely normal -- the queen's estate was about a mile away, and the young Princes Andrew and Edward (Diana's future in-laws) frequently visited to swim in the pool. \n\nWhen the butler would ring the gong for dinner, the children would rush to the stairs, slide down the wooden banister and run into the dining room. \n\nDespite growing up in the shadows of royalty, Crane and Mary Clarke, Diana's nanny starting at age 9, describe an \"ordinary\" childhood for Diana, a tomboy who loved going outdoors, climbing trees and playing with animals. \n'Question': did she have an aupair?\n'Answer: '",
