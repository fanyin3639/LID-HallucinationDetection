    "Answer the following questions:\nContext: One of the jurors who acquitted George Zimmerman said she had \"no doubt\" he feared for his life in the final moments of his struggle with Trayvon Martin, and that was the definitive factor in the verdict. \n\nThe woman, who was identified just as Juror B37, spoke exclusively to CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360\" on Monday night. She is the first juror to speak publicly about the case. \n\nShe said she believes Zimmerman's \"heart was in the right place\" the night he shot Martin, but that he didn't use \"good judgment\" in confronting the Florida teen. \n\n\"I think George Zimmerman is a man whose heart was in the right place, but just got displaced by the vandalism in the neighborhoods, and wanting to catch these people so badly that he went above and beyond what he really should have done,\" she said. \n\nFringe protesters turn violent in LA after Zimmerman verdict \n\n\"But I think his heart was in the right place. It just went terribly wrong.\" \n\nIf anything, Zimmerman was guilty of not using \"good judgment,\" the juror said. \n\n\"When he was in the car, and he had called 911, he shouldn't have gotten out of that car,\" she said. \n\nShe also said she believes Martin threw the first punch in the confrontation that followed. \n\n\"I think George got in a little bit too deep, which he shouldn't have been there. But Trayvon decided that he wasn't going to let him scare him ... and I think Trayvon got mad and attacked him,\" she said. \n'Question': Who did she talk with?\n'Answer: '",
