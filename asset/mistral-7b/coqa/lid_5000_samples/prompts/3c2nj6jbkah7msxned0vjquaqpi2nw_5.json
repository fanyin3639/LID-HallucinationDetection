    "Answer the following questions:\nContext: Spain and its autonomous communities are divided into fifty provinces (, ; sing. \"provincia\"). Ceuta, Melilla and the Plazas de soberan\u00eda are not part of any provinces. \n\nThe layout of Spain's provinces closely follows the pattern of the territorial division of the country carried out in 1833. The only major change of provincial borders since that time has been the sub-division of the Canary Islands into two provinces rather than one. \n\nHistorically, the provinces served mainly as transmission belts for policies enacted in Madrid, as Spain was a highly centralised state for most of its history. The importance of the provinces has declined since the adoption of the system of autonomous communities in the period of the Spanish transition to democracy. They nevertheless remain electoral districts for national elections and as geographical references: for instance in postal addresses and telephone codes. \n\nA small town would normally be identified as being in, say, Valladolid province rather than the autonomous community of Castile and Le\u00f3n. The provinces were the \"building-blocks\" from which the autonomous communities were created. Consequently, no province is divided between more than one of these communities. \n\nMost of the provinces\u2014with the exception of \u00c1lava/Araba, Asturias/Asturies, Bizkaia/Vizcaya, Cantabria, Gipuzkoa/Gip\u00fazcoa, Illes Balears/Islas Baleares, La Rioja, and Nafarroa/Navarra\u2014are named after their principal town. Only two capitals of autonomous communities\u2014M\u00e9rida in Extremadura and Santiago de Compostela in Galicia\u2014are not also the capitals of provinces.\n'Question': How many aren't?\n'Answer: '",
