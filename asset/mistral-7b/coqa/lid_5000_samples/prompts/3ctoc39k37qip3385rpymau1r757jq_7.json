But in recent months, even China's breakneck economic pace has hit some speed bumps. \n\nOn the broader geopolitical front, Rudd wants China and the United States to carve out a new Asia-Pacific \"strategic road-map\" that will enhance trade, investment and security in the region. \n\nREAD MORE: Rudd: Better second time around? \n\nThe Opposition's view on China \n\nAbbott, who has led the opposition Liberal Party since 2009, wants the Australia-China relationship to move from one based on shared interests to one of \"shared values.\" \n\nBut he notes that Australia's friendship with China is more recent than that with Japan, and less developed than that with the United States. \n\nIn a major policy speech to a business audience in Beijing last year, Abbott said he believed it would take time before Australia's ties with China approached \"the warmth that we take for granted with America.\" Still, he believes it is an effort worth making. \n\nLike his mentor, former Australian prime minister John Howard, Abbott is a rock-solid supporter of Australia's military alliance with the United States, and believes that it is possible to be friends both with Washington and Beijing.
