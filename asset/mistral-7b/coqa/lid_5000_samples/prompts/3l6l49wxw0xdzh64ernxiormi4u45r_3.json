    "Answer the following questions:\nContext: CHAPTER X \n\nAfter nearly a year's captivity, the King engaged to pay a ransom, and, until the terms could be arranged, his two sons were to be placed as hostages in the hands of the Normans, whilst he returned to his own domains. The Princes were to be sent to Bayeux; whither Richard had returned, under the charge of the Centevilles, and was now allowed to ride and walk abroad freely, provided he was accompanied by a guard. \n\n\"I shall rejoice to have Carloman, and make him happy,\" said Richard; \"but I wish Lothaire were not coming.\" \n\n\"Perhaps,\" said good Father Lucas, \"he comes that you may have a first trial in your father's last lesson, and Abbot Martin's, and return good for evil.\" \n\nThe Duke's cheek flushed, and he made no answer. \n\nHe and Alberic betook themselves to the watch-tower, and, by and by, saw a cavalcade approaching, with a curtained vehicle in the midst, slung between two horses. \"That cannot be the Princes,\" said Alberic; \"that must surely be some sick lady.\" \n\n\"I only hope it is not the Queen,\" exclaimed Richard, in dismay. \"But no; Lothaire is such a coward, no doubt he was afraid to ride, and she would not trust her darling without shutting him up like a demoiselle. But come down, Alberic; I will say nothing unkind of Lothaire, if I can help it.\" \n\nRichard met the Princes in the court, his sunny hair uncovered, and bowing with such becoming courtesy, that Fru Astrida pressed her son's arm, and bade him say if their little Duke was not the fairest and noblest child in Christendom. \n'Question': Where were they to go?\n'Answer: '",
