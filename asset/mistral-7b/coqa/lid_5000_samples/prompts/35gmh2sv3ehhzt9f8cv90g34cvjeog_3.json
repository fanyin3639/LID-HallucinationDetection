The smell of tuna was in the air and the cat followed the scent to the kitchen. A woman was making a tuna sandwich for her two kids. When she finished, she put the tuna can on to the floor.

He ran away into the other and back to under the couch where it was safe.\n'Question': Who was using tuna?\n'Answer: '",
