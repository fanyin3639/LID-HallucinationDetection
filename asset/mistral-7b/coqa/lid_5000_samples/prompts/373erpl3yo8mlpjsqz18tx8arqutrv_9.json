    "Answer the following questions:\nContext: Arthur sat at the desk in his room, pencil in hand. He had to write a story for his English class by Friday. \"! don't know what to write about, \" he complained to his dog Toby, who was asleep at his feet. Arthur was talkative when speaking to his friends, yet he had trouble finding words when he had to write. \n\nBy bedtime Arthur had drawn a picture of Toby smiling. He had drawn a tree with its branches blowing in the strong wind. He had also written a note asking his friend Lee to go to the movies on Saturday. But he had not written a single word of his story. \n\nOn Wednesday, Mrs. Solomon, Arthur's English teacher, asked the class to turn in the first draft of their stories. His heart sinking, Arthur turned in the only work he had--the page with his name, the drawings and the note. \n\nArthur wasn't surprised when Mrs. Solomon asked him to stay after class the next day. But he was surprised by what she said to him. \" This is an attractive story, Arthur. The dog, the movie, the tree in the wind--I can't wait to find out how they all fit together. \" \n\n\"That isn't my story, Mrs. Solomon, \" Arthur admitted. \"I haven't been able to think of one yet. \" \n\n\"Oh, I think you have the seed of a story there, \" Mrs. Solomon replied, \"Look at your note and the pictures and see if a story comes to you. \" \n\nThat night Arthur sat at his desk, and this is what he wrote: \"One Saturday Mike went downstairs to meet his friend Julio at the cinema. It looked as if it might rain, so Mike carried his umbrella. Suddenly a big storm blew in, bending the trees. The noise of the wind sounded like the barking of Mike's dog Toby. Toby really hated storms and barked whenever he wanted to be let inside. Then Mike realized that it wasn't the sound of the wind. It was Toby. The dog was running after him down the busy street, barking. The sound was filled with blame. Mike felt guilty because he had left Toby outside. He turned and headed home with Toby running beside him. Mike let Toby in the door just as the rain started to pour down. \" \n\nArthur had a story in the end. The last thing he did was to write his name proudly at the top of the page.\n'Question': Did Arthur have a story in the end?\n'Answer: '",
