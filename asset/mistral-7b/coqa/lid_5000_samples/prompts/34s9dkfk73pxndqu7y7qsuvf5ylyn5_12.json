Her piercing blue eyes dart around the room -- at her family, at the cameras broadcasting live to televisions around Australia, at the ground, at her interpreter. Then reality sets in. \n\nGuilty -- the judge said. Her sentence? Twenty years in a Bali prison. \n\nAt the back of the court, members of her family erupt with anger. \n\n\"It's not alright!
