It is so altogether different that I am almost afraid of it, and yet I've a sneaking idea it is good. You be judge. It's an Hawaiian story. I've called it 'Wiki-wiki.'\" \n\nHis face was bright with the creative glow, though she shivered in the cold room and had been struck by the coldness of his hands at greeting. She listened closely while he read, and though he from time to time had seen only disapprobation in her face, at the close he asked:- \n\n\"Frankly, what do you think of it?\" \n\n\"I--I don't know,\" she, answered. \"Will it--do you think it will sell?\" \n\n\"I'm afraid not,\" was the confession. \"It's too strong for the magazines. But it's true, on my word it's true.\" \n\n\"But why do you persist in writing such things when you know they won't sell?\" she went on inexorably. \"The reason for your writing is to make a living, isn't it?\" \n'Question': How sure is he?\n'Answer: '",
