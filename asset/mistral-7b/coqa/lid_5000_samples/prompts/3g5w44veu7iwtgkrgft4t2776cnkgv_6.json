Herrara was delighted to hear that he was to be made a lieutenant-colonel in his army. Bull and Macwitty were overjoyed on hearing that they had both been recommended for commissions, and Herrara's troopers were equally pleased. The rank and file felt no less gratification, both at the honour of being attached to the British army, and at the substantial improvement in their condition that this would entail. \n\nOn the following day Herrara's friends and Mary O'Connor left for Lisbon, and the latter astonished Terence by bursting into tears as she said good-bye to him. \n\n\"I have said nothing yet of the gratitude that I feel to you, Terence, for all that you have done for me, for you have always stopped me whenever I have tried to, but I shall always feel it, always; and shall think of you and love you dearly.\" \n\n\"It has been just as fortunate for me as it has been good for you, Mary,\" he said. \"I have never had a sister, and I seem to have found one now.\" \n\nThe girl looked up, pouting. \"I don't think,\" she said, \"I should particularly care about being a sister; I think that I would rather remain a cousin.\" \n\nTerence looked surprised and a little hurt. \n\n\"You are only a silly boy,\" she laughed, \"but will understand better some day. Well, good-bye, Terence,\" and the smile faded from her face. \n'Question': Anyone else?\n'Answer: '",
