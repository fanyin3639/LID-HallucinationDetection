    "Answer the following questions:\nContext: Las Vegas (CNN)Tammy Meyers and Erich Nowsch were neighbors. Their homes are walking distance from each other and from a park. \n\nIt was in that park where, according to Meyers' husband, she used to talk to the young man, where she implored him to act like an adult. \n\nOn Thursday, Nowsch was arrested, accused of killing Meyers in what has been described as a road rage incident that ended a week ago with a shooting in front of Meyers' home. \n\n\"We know this boy. I couldn't tell you this before,\" Robert Meyers told reporters after the arrest. \"He knew where I lived. We knew how bad he was, but we didn't know it was this bad. That he'd gotten to this point, and his friends.\" \n\nNowsch, 19, faces three felony charges: murder, attempted murder and unlawful discharge of a gun from a vehicle. A Monday morning court hearing has been scheduled. \n\nRobert Meyers said his wife tried to help Nowsch. \n\n\"My wife spent countless hours at that park consoling this boy,\" he said. \"She was really good to him. She fed him, she gave him money. She told him to pull his pants up and to be a man. More times than I can count.\" \n\nPolice said they are looking for at least one more suspect, but they believe Nowsch was the shooter. Homicide Capt. Chris Tomaino told reporters that he owned registered firearms but wouldn't say how many guns or what type of weapons they were. \n\nIt was unclear Thursday night whether Nowsch had an attorney; court documents detailing his charges didn't list a lawyer. \n'Question': When?\n'Answer: '",
