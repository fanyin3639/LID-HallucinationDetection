    "Answer the following questions:\nContext: CHAPTER XXXII \n\nLITTLE NELL--CONCLUSION \n\nJean Bevoir was now thoroughly cowed, and once having exposed himself he did all in his power to curry favor with those he had so deeply wronged, in the hope that they would relent in their treatment of him and perhaps grant him his ultimate liberty. But neither Henry nor the others would make him any promises, for nobody had any intention of letting him go free. \n\n\"He deserves to become a prisoner,\" said Dave. \"And he ought to be put in solitary confinement and on bread and water.\" \n\n\"Right ye are, lad,\" said Barringford. \"He's wuss nor a snake in the grass. I don't wonder Henry felt like pepperin' him on the spot.\" \n\nIt was well along in the middle of the afternoon and the rangers who had been out on the hunt were thoroughly tired, yet it was arranged that those who had remained in camp should move to the cave near the falls without delay, after getting minute directions from Jean Bevoir, so that there should be no chance of making a mistake in the route. A strict guard was ordered over the trader and he was given to understand that if anything went wrong with those who set out on the search for little Nell and the others the blame would fall upon him. \n\nIt must be said that the hearts of both Henry and Dave beat rapidly as they pushed along the trail leading towards the falls. Henry, as we know, loved his little sister dearly, and Dave's affection for his little cousin was scarcely less strong. Throughout the whole campaign there had not been a day when they had not thought of her and of what she must be suffering. \n'Question': And Dave?\n'Answer: '",
