    "Answer the following questions:\nContext: (CNN) -- The man labeled the most powerful vice president in American history remains resolute in his steadfast defense of his time in the White House in a new documentary that begins airing Friday. \n\n\"I did what I did. It's all on the public record, and I feel very good about it. If I had to do it over again, I'd do it in a minute,\" Dick Cheney says in \"The World According to Dick Cheney,\" which debuts at 9 p.m. ET on Showtime. \n\nThe two-hour documentary tells the story of Cheney's life through his own comments, supplemented by a narrator and interviews with journalists, biographers, former aides and his longtime friend and mentor Donald Rumsfeld, the former secretary of Defense. \n\nWhile the film covers Cheney's unprecedented and controversial role as vice president, the first half of the film explores the surprising tale of his rise from a two-time Yale dropout with two drunk-driving arrests to the man who once stood behind the leader of the free world. \n\nIn \"The World According to Dick Cheney,\" produced by R.J. Cutler \u2014 also known for \"The War Room\" and \"The September Issue\" -- the former Washington powerhouse gets personal, but he still maintains his ever-steady, matter-of-fact tone. \n\n\"When you came in at night after work, you'd go to the bar and down large quantities of Coors beer,\" he stated coolly, referring to the two times he was arrested for drinking and driving in his home state of Wyoming. \n\nNoticeably absent from the documentary are details about Cheney's post-White House life. The 72-year-old gives little to no insight about his heart transplant last year or his decision to support same-sex marriage. His younger daughter Mary wed her longtime partner Heather Poe in June. \n'Question': Who is starring in the documentary?\n'Answer: '",
