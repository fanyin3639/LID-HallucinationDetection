    "Answer the following questions:\nContext: CHAPTER XIX. \n\nNow alone, Bathurst threw himself down among the bashes in an attitude of utter depression. \n\n\"Why wasn't I killed with the others?\" he groaned. \"Why was I not killed when I sat there by her side?\" \n\nSo he lay for an hour, and then slowly rose and looked round. There was a faint light in the sky. \n\n\"It will be light in another hour,\" he said to himself, and he again sat down. Suddenly he started. Had someone spoken, or had he fancied it? \n\n\"Wait till I come.\" \n\nHe seemed to hear the words plainly, just as he had heard Rujub's summons before. \n\n\"That's it; it is Rujub. How is it that he can make me hear in this way? I am sure it was his voice. Anyhow, I will wait. It shows he is thinking of me, and I am sure he will help me. I know well enough I could do nothing by myself.\" \n\nBathurst assumed with unquestioning faith that Isobel Hannay was alive. He had no reason for his confidence. That first shower of grape might have killed her as it killed others, but he would not admit the doubt in his mind. Wilson's description of what had happened while he was insensible was one of the grounds of this confidence. \n\nHe had heard women scream. Mrs. Hunter and her daughter were the only other women in the boat. Isobel would not have screamed had those muskets been pointed at her, nor did he think the others would have done so. They screamed when they saw the natives about to murder those who were with them. The three women were sitting together, and if one had fallen by the grape shot all would probably have been killed. He felt confident, therefore, that she had escaped; he believed he would have known it had she been killed. \n'Question': Why did he think they weren't?\n'Answer: '",
