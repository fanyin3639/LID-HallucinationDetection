Gillian was at home, and every one found congeners. Lady Merrifield's sister, Miss Mohun, pounced upon Miss Prescott as a coadjutor in the alphabet of good works needed in the neglected district of Arnscombe, where Mr. Earl was wifeless, and the farm ladies heedless; but they were interrupted by Mysie running up to claim Miss Prescott for a game at croquet. \"Uncle Redgie was so glad to see the hoops come into fashion again,\" and Vera and Paula hardly knew the game, they had always played at lawn tennis; but they were delighted to learn, for Uncle Redgie proved to be a very fine-looking retired General, and there was a lad besides, grown to manly height; and one boy, at home for Easter, who, caring not for croquet, went with Primrose to exhibit to Thekla the tame menagerie, where a mungoose, called of course Raki raki, was the last acquisition. She was also shown the kittens of the beloved Begum, and presented with Phoebus, a tabby with a wise face and a head marked like a Greek lyre, to be transplanted to the Goyle in due time. \n\n\"If Sister will let me have it,\" said Thekla. \n\n\"Of course she will,\" said Primrose. \"Mysie says she is so jolly.\" \n\n\"Dear me! all the girls at our school said she was a regular Old Maid.\" \n\n\"What shocking bad form!\" exclaimed Primrose. \"Just like cads of girls,\" muttered Fergus, unheard; for Thekla continued--\"Why, they said she must be our maiden aunt, instead of our sister.\" \n'Question': What?\n'Answer: '",
