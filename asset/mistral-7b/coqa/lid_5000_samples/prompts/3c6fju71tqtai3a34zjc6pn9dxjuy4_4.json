    "Answer the following questions:\nContext: CHAPTER VIII \n\nA SCENE IN THE GYMNASIUM \n\nLew Flapp spoke in such a loud, overbearing voice that a crowd began to collect in the corner where the punching apparatus was located. \n\n\"What's up?\" asked more than one cadet. \n\n\"Lew Flapp and Dick Rover are going to try to beat each other at punching the bag,\" was the report. \n\n\"Rover will have to do his best then. Flapp is a prime one at bag punching. It's about the only thing he can do real well.\" \n\n\"This isn't a fair contest,\" put in another student. \"Flapp took lessons from a man who used to do bag-punching on the vaudeville stage.\" \n\n\"If that's so I wouldn't try to beat him, if I was Dick Rover.\" \n\nDick heard some of this talk but said nothing. He was soon ready for the trial, and stepping up to the punching bag he began to undo the top strap. \n\n\"That bag is all right,\" blustered Lew Flapp. \n\n\"Yes--for you,\" answered Dick. \"But you must remember, I am not quite so tall. I must have it an inch lower.\" \n\n\"It seems to me you are mighty particular.\" \n\n\"I have a right to be. When you do your punching you can raise the bag as high as you please.\" \n\n\"That's the talk,\" came from several standing near. \n\nBy this time Larry was on the floor again, and he came up to learn what Dick was doing. \n\n\"Dick, they tell me he is the best bag-puncher here,\" whispered Larry. \n\n\"I can't help it.\" \n'Question': What was the competition?\n'Answer: '",
