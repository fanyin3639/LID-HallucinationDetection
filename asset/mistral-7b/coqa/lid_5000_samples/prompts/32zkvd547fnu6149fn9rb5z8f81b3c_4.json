Giordano told authorities the two were snorkeling on August 2 when he signaled to Gardner to swim back. When he reached the beach, he told police, Gardner was nowhere to be found and has not been seen since. \n\n\"I only looked back when I hit a rock,\" he said, according to a transcript of a police interview obtained by CNN. \"Before that, I did not look back. I was busy saving my life.\" \n\nAruban judges repeatedly granted requests to extend Giordano's detention, while the investigation continued. But last week, a judge rejected prosecutors' request to hold Giordano, of Gaithersburg, Maryland, for an additional 30 days.
