    "Answer the following questions:\nContext: CHAPTER VIII \n\n\n\nFive minutes after Paula had left him, punctual to the second, the four telegrams disposed of, Dick was getting into a ranch motor car, along with Thayer, the Idaho buyer, and Naismith, the special correspondent for the _Breeders' Gazette_. Wardman, the sheep manager, joined them at the corrals where several thousand young Shropshire rams had been assembled for inspection. \n\nThere was little need for conversation. Thayer was distinctly disappointed in this, for he felt that the purchase of ten carloads of such expensive creatures was momentous enough to merit much conversation. \n\n\"They speak for themselves,\" Dick had assured him, and turned aside to give data to Naismith for his impending article on Shropshires in California and the Northwest. \n\n\"I wouldn't advise you to bother to select them,\" Dick told Thayer ten minutes later. \"The average is all top. You could spend a week picking your ten carloads and have no higher grade than if you had taken the first to hand.\" \n\nThis cool assumption that the sale was already consummated so perturbed Thayer, that, along with the sure knowledge that he had never seen so high a quality of rams, he was nettled into changing his order to twenty carloads. \n\nAs he told Naismith, after they had regained the Big House and as they chalked their cues to finish the interrupted game: \n\n\"It's my first visit to Forrest's. He's a wizard. I've been buying in the East and importing. But those Shropshires won my judgment. You noticed I doubled my order. Those Idaho buyers will be wild for them. I only had buying orders straight for six carloads, and contingent on my judgment for two carloads more; but if every buyer doesn't double his order, straight and contingent, when he sees them rams, and if there isn't a stampede for what's left, I don't know sheep. They're the goods. If they don't jump up the sheep game of Idaho ... well, then Forrest's no breeder and I'm no buyer, that's all.\" \n'Question': who disagreed?\n'Answer: '",
