However, at its founder Eddy's request, a daily religious article has appeared in every issue of the \"Monitor\". Eddy also required the inclusion of \"Christian Science\" in the paper's name, over initial opposition by some of her advisors who thought the religious reference might repel a secular audience. \n\nThe \"Monitor\"'s inception was, in part, a response by Eddy to the journalism of her day, which relentlessly covered the sensations and scandals surrounding her new religion with varying degrees of accuracy. In addition, Joseph Pulitzer's \"New York World\" was consistently critical of Eddy, and this, along with a derogatory article in \"McClure's\", furthered Eddy's decision to found her own media outlet.\n'Question': Did he influence Eddy to start the Monitor?\n'Answer: '",
