    "Answer the following questions:\nContext: A little over 26 years ago, Mohammad Reza Najafi started manufacturing auto parts in Iran. \n\nToday he's an industry leader, supplying roughly three million springs and one million break-pads every year to Iranian auto makers. \n\nNajafi's success has also earned him seats on the country's Chamber of Commerce and the board of directors of the Iranian Auto Parts Manufacturers Association. It has also made him a leading voice in Iran's efforts to re-energize its struggling economy. \n\nLike many of his country's business leaders, Najafi has watched the recent negotiations with world powers on Iran's nuclear program with great interest. \n\nHe spoke to CNN's Reza Sayah on this week's Marketplace Middle East, sharing his thoughts on how he sees the talks panning out and the impact they will have on the Iranian economy going forward. \n\nReza Sayah (RS): What was your reaction when they couldn't reach a deal (on the nuclear issue)? \n\nMohammad Reza Najafi (MRN): As a matter of fact it was a deal but naturally it takes time and we are happy that it is continuing. \n\nRS: Would you agree that Iran's economy is not going to improve without the sanctions being lifted? \n\nMRN: It's a very difficult question to answer because at the same time during the sanctions we tried to find our own way to improve ourselves and so on. \n\nBut we are interested to collaborate with them (the international community) so it is an obstacle that should be removed. \n\nRS: Tell me about Iran's economy today, where does it stand? \n'Question': What has that earned him?\n'Answer: '",
