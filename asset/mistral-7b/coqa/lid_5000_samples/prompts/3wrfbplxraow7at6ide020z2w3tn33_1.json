    "Answer the following questions:\nContext: (CNN) -- Who is Stanislas Cordova? That's the burning question at the heart of \"Night Film,\" the anticipated follow-up to best-selling author Marisha Pessl's 2006 literary debut. \n\nPessl burst onto the scene in 2006 with \"Special Topics in Calamity Physics.\" She received a six-figure advance, almost unheard of for a first-time author, a ton of hype and even some snarky backlash over her photogenic looks. But the book lived up to expectations, selling some 200,000 copies and landing on The New York Times' list of Best Books of 2006. \n\nSeven years later, \"Night Film\" is hitting bookstores this week amid greater expectations and even more hype. Movie rights are already spoken for by Chernin Entertainment, the studio behind \"Oblivion\" and \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,\" and critics are raving about Pessl's multimedia storytelling approach, which takes readers beyond the novel's pages to explore the story of a mysterious director and the washed-up reporter out to expose him. \n\nPessl's fictional mash-up of Stanley Kubrick, Roman Polanski and David Lynch hasn't been seen in public for 30 years. His movies are so frightening no theater will show them; his cult of fans meet in abandoned buildings and underground tunnels for secret screenings. \n\nInvestigative journalist Scott McGrath tried to expose Cordova years ago and it backfired, costing him his job, marriage and reputation. When Cordova's daughter turns up dead in an apparent suicide, McGrath sees an opportunity to exact revenge against the man he blames for his downfall. \n\nPessl weaves into the narrative excerpts from magazine articles, newspaper headlines, police reports, crime scene photos and screen shots of online message boards. She also wrote and directed several short films being featured over the next few weeks on YouTube that offer clues into the book's mystery, including snippets and trailers from Cordova's films. \n'Question': What about in 2006, what book came out?\n'Answer: '",
