    "Answer the following questions:\nContext: CHAPTER VI.\u2014LEO ASSERTS HIS RIGHTS. \n\nAt once a crowd of performers surrounded the pair. Very few of them liked Jack Snipper, and they wondered what Leo would do should the gymnast attack the boy. \n\n\u201cCall me a braggart, will you!\u201d roared Snipper. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare to touch me with that club!\u201d replied Leo calmly. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll teach you a lesson!\u201d \n\nAnd, swinging the Indian club over his head, Jack Snipper made a savage blow at the young gymnast. \n\nHad the stick struck Leo the boy\u2019s head would have sustained a severe injury. \n\nBut as quick as a flash Leo dodged, and the Indian club merely circled through the empty air. \n\n\u201cFor shame, Snipper!\u201d \n\n\u201cDo you want to kill the boy?\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat harm has he done?\u201d \n\nAnd so the cries ran on. \n\n\u201cMind your own affairs!\u201d shouted the maddened gymnast. \u201cI\u2019m going to teach the boy a lesson!\u201d \n\nAgain he sprang at Leo. \n\nBut now suddenly the Indian club was caught. A dexterous twist, and it went flying out of reach across the dressing tent. \n\nThen, before Snipper could recover, he received a stinging slap full in the face that sent him staggering backward on the grass. \n\nA shout of approval went up. \n\n\u201cGood for Leo!\u201d \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, boy, stand up for your rights!\u201d \n\nThe shout brought Adam Lambert, the general manager, to the scene. \n\nNo sooner had he appeared than all the performers walked away.
