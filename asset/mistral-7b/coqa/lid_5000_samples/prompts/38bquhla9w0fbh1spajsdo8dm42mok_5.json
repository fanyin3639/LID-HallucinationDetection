It can be considered a version of five-a-side football. \n\nFutsal is played between two teams of five players each, one of whom is the goalkeeper. Unlimited substitutions are permitted. Unlike some other forms of indoor football, the game is played on a hard court surface delimited by lines; walls or boards are not used. Futsal is also played with a smaller ball. The surface, ball, and rules create an emphasis on improvisation, creativity, and technique as well as ball control and passing in small spaces. \n\n\"Futsal\" comes from Spanish \"f\u00fatbol sala or f\u00fatbol de sal\u00f3n\" and from Portuguese \"futebol de sal\u00e3o\". The term is commonly translated as \"indoor football\" but a more literal translation is \"hall/lounge football\". During the sport's second world championships held in Madrid in 1985, the Spanish name \"f\u00fatbol sala\" was used. Since then, all other names have been officially and internationally changed to \"futsal\". The naming was due to a dispute between FIFUSA (the predecessor to the AMF) and FIFA over the name of \"f\u00fatbol\", FIFUSA has registered the word \"fut-sal\" in 1985 (Madrid, Spain). Since then FIFA has also started using the term futsal.
