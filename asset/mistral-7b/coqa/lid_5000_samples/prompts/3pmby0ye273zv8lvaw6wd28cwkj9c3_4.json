    "Answer the following questions:\nContext: One day, my family took a vacation to the beach. We were in our car for over 10 hours but it felt like we were in the car for maybe 11, 12, or 13 hours! We thought it would only be 8 hours, but we got lost. My mom and dad were in the front seat, and my sister and I were in the back seat. My sister and I were very bored, but we had to sit still and stay quiet for a lot of the time because our dad needed to be a good driver. My sister and I played with our dolls, or we tried to play easy games. I could not read or eat in the car because I felt too sick. My sister spilled Coke on the car and my mom spanked her with a glove. The look of sadness on my sister's face almost made me cry, too! We got to the ocean so late at night, but we took a nice walk next to the ocean and then we went to bed. We were so tired from doing nothing all day! The next morning we woke up early and ran to the beach and we saw so many animals! We saw dolphins, turtles, and fish! We were hoping to see a shark, but I'm glad we did not. When it was lunch time we played with some chalk and mother made lunch. I was very happy and had a great vacation!\n'Question': Did you talk to her a lot?\n'Answer: '",
