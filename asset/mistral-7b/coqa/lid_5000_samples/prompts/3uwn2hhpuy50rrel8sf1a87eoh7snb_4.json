    "Answer the following questions:\nContext: CHAPTER XXXI. \n\nNELLIE ARDELL'S TROUBLES. \n\nOn the following morning Jerry went to work at the bindery as if nothing had happened. When he went in, Dick Lanning glared at our hero and stopped as if to speak, but changed his mind and walked off without saying a word. \n\nDuring the day the young oarsman became much better acquainted with his work and began to like it. \n\nThat night, on leaving the bindery by the side entrance, which opened on a narrow lane, our hero saw Dick Lanning and several of his friends waiting for him. \n\nHe attempted to pass but Lenning put out his foot, and had Jerry not stopped he would have been tripped up. \n\n\"Let me pass,\" said he, sharply, but instead of complying, Lenning took a stand in front of him and hit the youth on the shoulder. \n\n\"I said I'd git square,\" he hissed, savagely. \"If yer ain't afraid, stand up and fight.\" \n\n\"I'm not afraid,\" replied Jerry, and pushed him up against the wall. \n\nWithout delay a rough-and-tumble fight ensued. \n\n\"Give it to him, Dick!\" \n\n\"Do the hayseed up!\" \n\n\"Knock him into the middle of next week!\" \n\nThese and a dozen other cries arose on the air, and the crowd kept increasing until fully a hundred spectators surrounded the pair. \n\nDick Lanning had caught Jerry unfairly, but the youth soon managed to shake him off, and, hauling back, gave him a clean blow on the end of his unusually long nose, which caused the blood to spurt from that organ in a stream. \n'Question': Did the two men go dancing after work?\n'Answer: '",
