    "Answer the following questions:\nContext: CHAPTER X \n\nBRINGING IN SOME GAME \n\nThe snowstorm proved such a heavy one that for three days the party at Professor Jeffer's cabin were completely stormbound. Once Andy and Chet went out--in an endeavor to bring the dead moose in, but were unable to accomplish their object. \n\nDuring the time spent at the cabin, the boys became very well acquainted with Barwell Dawson, and found the hunter and explorer a person very much to their liking. Although he was rich and well educated, he did not act as if he considered himself above them. He took a lively interest in all they had to tell, and knew how to \"draw them out,\" so that, almost before he knew it, Andy had related the details of his troubles with his shiftless Uncle Si and with the mysterious Mr. A. Q. Hopton. \n\n\"More than likely that fellow, Hopton, will bear close watching,\" said Barwell Dawson. \"If he is a sharper--and it looks as if he might be--he will try to swindle both you and your uncle. It was very unwise for your uncle to try to do business with him without seeing a lawyer.\" \n\n\"Uncle Si wanted to get the money without my knowing it,\" answered Andy, bitterly. He was glad to open his heart to somebody who could understand him. \n\n\"I believe you--and that is not to your uncle's credit. You say he is shiftless and lazy?\" \n\n\"Very--and everybody around here knows it.\" \n\n\"Then he is not fit to be your guardian.\" \n'Question': what is he like?\n'Answer: '",
