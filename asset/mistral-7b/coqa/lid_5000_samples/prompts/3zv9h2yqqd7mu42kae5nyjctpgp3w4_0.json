    "Answer the following questions:\nContext: CHAPTER III. \n\nA RAFT. \n\nForester and Marco did not take breakfast on board the steamboat, but waited until they got on shore. They had inquired of a fellow-passenger, who seemed acquainted with the country, and were told that there was a very good tavern about a quarter of a mile from the mill. \n\nWhen they landed upon the logs, Marco, whose curiosity seemed to be stronger than his appetite, wanted to ramble about for a little time along the shore and among the piles of boards, but Forester thought it would be best first to go and get their breakfast. \n\n\"Because,\" said he, \"we can then amuse ourselves by rambling about here, and shall be ready to return to the steamboat whenever they send for us.\" \n\nSo they went to the tavern. \n\nForester seemed to have little appetite for his breakfast. He complained of feeling fatigued, and yet he had nothing to fatigue him. Marco ate, and talked fast all the time; but Forester seemed silent and dejected. \n\n\"Come, cousin Forester, what is the matter with you?\" said Marco at last. \n\nForester said that he felt somewhat unwell, and as there was a sofa in the room, he concluded to lie down upon it, and not go out. Marco was, at first, disposed to stay and take care of him, but Forester said that he did not need anything, and he wished Marco to go out and amuse himself. \n\n\"You may go and see the mill,\" said he, \"and the logs along the shore; only be careful not to go where there is any danger; and come and let me know when the boat is coming from the steamer to take us on board again.\" \n'Question': What did they land on\n'Answer: '",
