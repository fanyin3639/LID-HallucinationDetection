    "Answer the following questions:\nContext: Strabo (; \"Strab\u014dn\"; 64 or 63 BC) was a Greek geographer, philosopher, and historian who lived in Asia Minor during the transitional period of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. \n\nStrabo was born to an affluent family from Amaseia in Pontus (modern Amasya, Turkey), a city that he said was situated the approximate equivalent of 75\u00a0km from the Black Sea. Pontus had recently fallen to the Roman Republic, and although politically he was a proponent of Roman imperialism, Strabo belonged on his mother's side to a prominent family whose members had held important positions under the previous resisting regime of King Mithridates\u00a0VI of Pontus. \n\nStrabo's life was characterized by extensive travels. He journeyed to Egypt and Kush, as far west as coastal Tuscany and as far south as Ethiopia in addition to his travels in Asia Minor and the time he spent in Rome. Travel throughout the Mediterranean and Near East, especially for scholarly purposes, was popular during this era and was facilitated by the relative peace enjoyed throughout the reign of Augustus (27\u00a0BC \u2013 AD\u00a014). He moved to Rome in 44\u00a0BC, and stayed there, studying and writing, until at least 31\u00a0BC. In 29\u00a0BC, on his way to Corinth (where Augustus was at the time), he visited the island of Gyaros in the Aegean Sea. Around 25\u00a0BC, he sailed up the Nile until reaching Philae, after which point there is little record of his proceedings until AD 17.\n'Question': Where was he in 29 BC?\n'Answer: '",
