After placing the dish upon the table, she stood looking earnestly at him for a minute, and then said: \n\n\"You spoke of stopping here tonight, sir. The accommodation is very poor and, if you will take my advice, you will ride farther. There have been some men along here this afternoon, inquiring for a party like yours; and offering a reward to any who would carry the news to them, should you pass through. Methinks their intentions were not friendly.\" \n\n\"I thank you very much for your counsel,\" Philip said, \"and will take it. I know that there are some who would gladly hinder me, in my journey; and if there is, as you say, a risk of their coming here for me, it were as well that I rode farther, although I would gladly have given my horses a night's rest. I thank you warmly for having warned me.\" \n\n\"Do not let my husband know that I have spoken to you,\" she said. \"He is an honest man, but timid; and in these days 'tis safest not to meddle with what does not concern one.\" \n\nPhilip waited for two hours, and then told Pierre to saddle the horses, and tell the landlord that he wished to speak to him. \n'Question': How is the guy?\n'Answer: '",
