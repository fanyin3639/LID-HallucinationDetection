    "Answer the following questions:\nContext: Stephen Colbert plays a dangerous game. \n\nHe walks a tightrope every night, and it's amazing that he doesn't fall on a regular basis. He tells jokes about race, gender, class and people love him or hate him. Does everyone get a joke? No. But of course he does say, in persona, amazingly offensive things sometimes. \n\nLast week things went south, and Twitter exploded in calls to #CancelColbert. \n\nThe offense? A 140-character long foot-in-the-mouth that came from the Twitter feed @ColbertReport. The tweet was a joke that played off of a show segment that mocked an attempt by the owner of the Washington Redskins to make peace with the Native American community without having to change the team's name. \n\n\"I'm willing to show the #Asian community I care by introducing the Ching-Chong Ding-Dong Foundation for Sensitivity to Orientals or Whatever.\" \n\nRace, meet satire. But it didn't work. \n\nThe controversial tweet, it turns out, was not written by Colbert himself, or from anyone on his show. But it was a Comedy Central account that presumably had license from the show's producers to publicize and magnify Colbert's voice. \n\nBut instead of repudiating the tweet, Colbert on Monday night made further jokes about how the incident almost silenced \"my message of core conservative principles mixed with youth-friendly product placement.\" \n\nFollowing the lead of Asian-American activist Suey Park, some have been demanding that \"The Colbert Report\" be canceled. These words perpetuate hateful stereotypes and bring up a history of very public repression and personal shame. To use them now is to call forth that history. And in calling it forth, these words create more racism. \n'Question': who is that one about\n'Answer: '",
