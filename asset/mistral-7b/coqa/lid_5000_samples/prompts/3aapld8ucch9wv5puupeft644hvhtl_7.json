    "Answer the following questions:\nContext: Andy never wanted to go to bed on time. His parents had explained to him how important it was to go to bed early and get a good rest. But Andy paid no attention to them, and they didn't know what to do until one weekend when they were visiting Andy's grandparents. \n\nGrandpa Peter heard all about it and said, \"This sounds like a job for Tubby.\" So Andy's parents loaded the cat onto the car and returned home. \n\nThat night, at bedtime, the same problem happened. Andy didn't want to go to bed, and even though his parents waited a while to see if Tubby would solve the problem, nothing happened. [:++Z+X+X+K] \n\nHours later, Andy finally decided to go to bed. But what a surprise when he entered his bedroom! Tubby was in his bed, totally sprawling out, pot-belly in the air, and _ like an express train. \n\nAndy tried to move the cat, but there was no way of moving him an inch. That night he hardly slept, lying on one tiny corner of his bed. \n\nThe next day the same thing happened, even though Andy was much more tired from not having slept well. When the third day arrived, he had understood that if he wanted to sleep in his bed, he would have to get into it before Tubby did. That night, when his parents only started to mention the topic of bedtime, Andy rushed upstairs and dived into bed. His parents could not believe it. They knew nothing about Tubby in the bed, nor did they understand why Andy went to bed on time without complaint. They were so happy about this that they stayed up quite late, celebrating.\n'Question': What happened the next day?\n'Answer: '",
