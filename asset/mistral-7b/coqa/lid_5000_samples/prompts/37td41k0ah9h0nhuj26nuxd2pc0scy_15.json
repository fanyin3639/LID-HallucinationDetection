She will eventually head to a processing center in Europe before leaving for a final destination. \n\nShe has told CNN on repeated occasions that she wants to go to the United States. \n\nOne of the State Department sources told CNN that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \"has been deeply interested in the case and has followed it throughout.\" \n\nAl-Obeidy was in Qatar awaiting resettlement as a refugee when she was deported Thursday and sent back to Libya.
