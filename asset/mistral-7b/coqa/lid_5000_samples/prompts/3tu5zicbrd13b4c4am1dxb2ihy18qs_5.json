That's the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall. But he had to have it; Tom said he'd GOT to; there warn't no case of a state prisoner not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind, and his coat of arms. \n\n\"Look at Lady Jane Grey,\" he says; \"look at Gilford Dudley; look at old Northumberland! Why, Huck, s'pose it IS considerble trouble?--what you going to do?--how you going to get around it? Jim's GOT to do his inscription and coat of arms. They all do.\" \n\nJim says: \n\n\"Why, Mars Tom, I hain't got no coat o' arm; I hain't got nuffn but dish yer ole shirt, en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat.\" \n\n\"Oh, you don't understand, Jim; a coat of arms is very different.\" \n\n\"Well,\" I says, \"Jim's right, anyway, when he says he ain't got no coat of arms, because he hain't.\" \n\n\"I reckon I knowed that,\" Tom says, \"but you bet he'll have one before he goes out of this--because he's going out RIGHT, and there ain't going to be no flaws in his record.\" \n\nSo whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece, Jim a-making his'n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon, Tom set to work to think out the coat of arms. By and by he said he'd struck so many good ones he didn't hardly know which to take, but there was one which he reckoned he'd decide on. He says: \n'Question': do they all have one?\n'Answer: '",
