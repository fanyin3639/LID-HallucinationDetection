Much of the West is marking the anniversary with new translations of the author's works, including War and Peace. Movies are being released, including a black-and-white documentary and a feature film. In short, everyone is celebrating. Everyone, that is, except for people in Tolstoy's home country, Russia. \n\nThe English newspaper the Guardian reports that the Russian government has scheduled nothing for November, the official anniversary of Tolstoy's death. The quiet is amazing, considering the importance of this man's contribution to global culture. \n\n\"Across the whole world there is a huge Tolstoy boom ,\" Andrei Deryabin, co-producer of a new film about the author's final days titled The Last Station, told the Guardian. \"He's esteemed everywhere apart from here in Russia.\" \n\nExperts explain the government's silence in various ways. Some refer to Tolstoy's disagreement with state-backed religion. Tolstoy's Christian views often _ those of the Roman Catholic church. \n\nHis great grandson, Vladimir Ilyich Tolstoy, thinks Russia's cool attitude has more to do with history and the author's positive worldview. After all, the last century was a difficult one of the country's people. The darker writings of Fyodor Dostoevsky, he says, better fit the national character. Tolstoy hopes that as Russians grow more optimistic they will rediscover one of their own national treasures. \n\n\"Tolstoy gives positive answers to the questions mankind is asking,\" he told the Guardian. \" In this sense he gives more hope. I hope the 21stcentury is Tolstoyan.\"\n'Question': What were they?\n'Answer: '",
