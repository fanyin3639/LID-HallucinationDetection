    "Answer the following questions:\nContext: CHAPTER VIII \n\n\"I AM WEARY OF A HOPELESS LOVE\" \n\nPaul and Arthur shared a bachelor residence in Mayfair; shared it, that is to say, insomuch as Paul had purchased it, and was the sole proprietor, and Arthur used it whenever he could get leave from his regiment. It was here Paul found his brother on the morning of his arrival in London. \n\nThey shook hands in silence; Paul did not wish to say anything for a moment. His brother's appearance had choked him. It was one o'clock, but he was still in his dressing-gown; with sunken, pale cheeks, save for one bright spot, and with faint, dark rims underneath his eyes. There were a pile of blue papers and some ominous-looking envelopes on the table before him, and Paul could not help noticing the intense pallor of the hand which rested upon them. \n\n\"I wish you would let a fellow know what time you were coming,\" Arthur said, rather peevishly, but with an attempt at a smile. \"I didn't expect you till evening, so I was having a shack before dressing. I was late last night!\" \n\nPaul banished his gravity, as far as possible, and stood with his hands in his pockets, leaning against the mantel-piece. He heartily disliked the part of mentor, and he did not wish to play it, unless he were obliged. \n\n\"It was beastly early to get up,\" he said, \"but the connection at Normanton is so much better. One has to wait two hours by the late train, and Normanton is such a hole. I don't know that I should have come up to town at all, just yet,\" he continued after a slight pause, \"only that I'm on the committee at the club this term, you know, and I haven't attended a single meeting yet. Besides, I promised Westover to put him up this time, and the half-yearly meeting's to-morrow, you know. Got any engagement? If not, you might dine with me there. Always a full night election time, you know!\" \n'Question': who owns it?\n'Answer: '",
