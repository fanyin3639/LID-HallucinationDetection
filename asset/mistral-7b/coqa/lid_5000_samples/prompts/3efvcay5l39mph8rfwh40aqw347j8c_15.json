    "Answer the following questions:\nContext: CHAPTER IX \n\nTen days later, Harper and Joe Ladue arrived at Sixty Mile, and Daylight, still a trifle weak, but strong enough to obey the hunch that had come to him, traded a third interest in his Stewart town site for a third interest in theirs on the Klondike. \n\nThey had faith in the Upper Country, and Harper left down-stream, with a raft-load of supplies, to start a small post at the mouth of the Klondike. \n\n\"Why don't you tackle Indian River, Daylight?\" Harper advised, at parting. \"There's whole slathers of creeks and draws draining in up there, and somewhere gold just crying to be found. That's my hunch. There's a big strike coming, and Indian River ain't going to be a million miles away.\" \n\n\"And the place is swarming with moose,\" Joe Ladue added. \"Bob Henderson's up there somewhere, been there three years now, swearing something big is going to happen, living off'n straight moose and prospecting around like a crazy man.\" \n\nDaylight decided to go Indian River a flutter, as he expressed it; but Elijah could not be persuaded into accompanying him. Elijah's soul had been seared by famine, and he was obsessed by fear of repeating the experience. \n\n\"I jest can't bear to separate from grub,\" he explained. \"I know it's downright foolishness, but I jest can't help it. It's all I can do to tear myself away from the table when I know I'm full to bustin' and ain't got storage for another bite. I'm going back to Circle to camp by a cache until I get cured.\" \n'Question': What did he not want to have happen again?\n'Answer: '",
