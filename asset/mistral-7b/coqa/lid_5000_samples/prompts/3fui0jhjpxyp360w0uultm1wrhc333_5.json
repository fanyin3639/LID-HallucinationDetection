Fans from as far afield as Japan, Germany and Dubai queued to buy their tickets. \n\nSteve Greenberg, founder and CEO of S-Curve Records, was a disc jockey in Tel Aviv, Israel, when \"Thriller\" first dropped and witnessed first-hand how Jackson became an international icon. \n\nHis was a global appeal, Greenberg said, among fans and artists worldwide. \n\n\"He was as big in the Middle East and Southeast Asia as he was in America and Europe,\" Greenberg said. \"He had that universality that not many people had. The Beatles had it, Muhammad Ali had it, but not many other people have had it.\" \n\nJackson was known for far more than his music though.
