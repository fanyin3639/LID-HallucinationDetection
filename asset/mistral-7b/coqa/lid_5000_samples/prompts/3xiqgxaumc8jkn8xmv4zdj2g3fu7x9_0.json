    "Answer the following questions:\nContext: Zen () is a school of Mahayana Buddhism that originated in China during the Tang dynasty as Chan Buddhism. Zen school was strongly influenced by Taoism and developed as a distinct school of Chinese Buddhism. From China, Chan Buddhism spread south to Vietnam, northeast to Korea and east to Japan, where it became known as Japanese Zen. \n\nThe term Zen is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the Middle Chinese word \u79aa (Chan) which traces its roots to the Indian practice of Dhyana (\"meditation\"). Zen emphasizes rigorous self-control, meditation-practice, insight into Buddha-nature, and the personal expression of this insight in daily life, especially for the benefit of others. As such, it de-emphasizes mere knowledge of sutras and doctrine and favors direct understanding through zazen and interaction with an accomplished teacher. \n\nThe teachings of Zen include various sources of Mahayana thought, especially Yogachara, the Tath\u0101gatagarbha s\u016btras and the Huayan school, with their emphasis on Buddha-nature, totality, and the Bodhisattva-ideal. The Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 literature and, to a lesser extent, Madhyamaka have also been influential in the shaping of the \"paradoxical language\" of the Zen-tradition. \n\nThe word \"Zen\" is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the Middle Chinese word \u79aa () (pinyin: \"Ch\u00e1n\"), which in turn is derived from the Sanskrit word \"dhy\u0101na\" (\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928 ), which can be approximately translated as \"absorption\" or \"meditative state\".\n'Question': Zen is part of which religion?\n'Answer: '",
