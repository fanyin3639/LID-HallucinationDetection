He saw some children playing and some women talking to each other happily. Suddenly he heard a girl crying. He came up to her and asked some questions. Then he knew she got lost.

Why did you keep me waiting for twenty minutes? \" John said nothing but one word--\"Sorry! \"\n'Question': What were the women doing?\n'Answer: '",
