VALENTINE'S DAY \n\n\n\nMiss Mohun came back in the dark after a long day, for once in her life quite jaded, and explaining that the health-officer and the landlord had been by no means agreed, and that nothing could be done till Sir Jasper came home and decided whether to retain the house or not. \n\nAll that she was clear about, and which she had telegraphed to Aden, was, that there must be no going back to Silverfold for the present, and she was prepared to begin lodging-hunting as soon as she received an answer. \n\n'And how have you got on?' she asked, thinking all looked rather blank. \n\n'We haven't been to see Fly,' broke out Valetta, 'though she went out on the beach, and Mysie must not stay out after dark, for fear she should cough.' \n\n'Mysie says they are afraid of excitement,' said Gillian gloomily. \n\n'Then you have seen nothing of the others?' \n\n'Yes, I have seen Victoria, said Aunt Adeline, with a meaning smile. \n\nMiss Mohun went up to take off her things, and Gillian followed her, shutting the door with ominous carefulness, and colouring all over. \n\n'Aunt Jane, I ought to tell you. A dreadful thing has happened!' \n\n'Indeed, my dear! What?' \n\n'I have had a valentine.' \n\n'Oh!' repressing a certain inclination to laugh at the bathos from the look of horror and shame in the girl's eyes. \n\n'It is from that miserable Alexis!
