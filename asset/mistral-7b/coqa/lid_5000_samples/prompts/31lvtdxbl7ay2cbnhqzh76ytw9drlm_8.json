    "Answer the following questions:\nContext: CHAPTER XXXVI \n\nTHE CHARLATAN UNMASKED \n\nThere seemed for the next few minutes to be a somewhat singular abstention from any desire to interfere with the two people who stood in the centre of the little group, hand-in-hand. Saton, after his first speech, and after Lois had given him her hands, had turned a little defiantly toward Rochester, who remained, however, unmoved, his elbow resting upon the broad mantelpiece, his face almost expressionless. Vandermere, too, stood on one side and held his peace, though the effort with which he did so was a visible one. Lady Mary looked anxiously towards them. Pauline had shrunk back, as though something in the situation terrified her. \n\nEven Saton himself felt that it was the silence before the storm. The courage which he had summoned up to meet a storm of disapproval, began to ebb slowly away in the face of this unnatural silence. It was clear that the onus of further speech was to rest with him. \n\nStill retaining Lois' hand, he turned toward Rochester. \n\n\"You have forbidden me to enter your house, or to hold any communication with your ward until she was of age, Mr. Rochester,\" he said. \"One of your conditions I have obeyed. With regard to the other, I have done as I thought fit. However, to-day she is her own mistress. She has consented to be my wife. I do not need to ask for your consent or approval. If you are not willing that she should be married from your roof, I can take her at once to the Comtesse, who is prepared to receive her.\" \n'Question': Who had shrunk back, terrified?\n'Answer: '",
