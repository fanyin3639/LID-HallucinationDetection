        "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Mar Yohannan VIII Hormizd (often referred to by European missionaries as John Hormez or Hanna Hormizd) (1760\u20131838) was the last hereditary patriarch of the Eliya line of the Church of the East and the first patriarch of a united Chaldean Church.  After succeeding his uncle Eliya XII Denha in 1780 as patriarch of Mosul, he made a Catholic profession of faith and was recognised in 1783 by the Vatican as patriarchal administrator and archbishop of Mosul. His career as patriarchal administrator was controversial, and was marked by a series of conflicts with his own bishops and also with the Vatican. Suspended from his functions in 1812 and again in 1818, he was reinstated by the Vatican in 1828.  In 1830, following the death of the Amid patriarchal administrator Augustine Hindi, he was recognised by the Vatican as patriarch of Babylon of the Chaldeans and the Mosul and Amid patriarchates were united under his leadership.
