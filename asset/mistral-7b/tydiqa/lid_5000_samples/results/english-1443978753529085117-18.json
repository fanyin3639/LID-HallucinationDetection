        "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Scorpion yells one of two taunts at his opponents when he hits them with his spear. They were voiced by Boon in the games and both feature films, but only one of them (\"Come here!\") was included in the home ports of MK and MKII due to memory constraints. According to Boon, the second of the character's phrases originated because he thought \"it would be funny to have him yell out 'Get over here!' when he [threw the spear],\" and he was thus encouraged to get behind the studio microphone and record the taunts.[28] As confirmed by Daniel Pesina,[29] that phrase was originally an idea of Kano's actor Richard Divizio, as was Scorpion's skull face, inspired by the classic film Jason and the Argonauts.[30] Twenty years after the first MK game's release, Boon included creating the spear move as well as the character itself among his personal high points of the franchise's history, adding: \"I remember people sitting in my office all day just doing this uppercut [on a speared enemy] again and again, like 'Oh my God, that feels so good.' It just became the cornerstone of [the game].\"[31] MKII saw the debut of the popular phrase \"Toasty!\", which was voiced by series sound designer Dan Forden during a variation of Scorpion's \"Flaming Skull\" Fatality or at random when any of the game's characters landed an uppercut. According to Tobias, it first originated as \"You're Toast!\", which was a taunt bandied among the designers during game-testing sessions.[32] Question: Who plays the voice of Scorpion in Mortal Kombat?
