        "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Mecca features a hot desert climate. Mecca retains its hot temperature in winter, which can range from 18\u00b0C (64\u00b0F) at night to 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F) in the day. Summer temperatures are extremely hot, often being over 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F) during the day, dropping to 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F) at night.[1]  Rain usually falls in Mecca in small amounts between November and January. The rainfall, as scant as it is, also presents the threat of flooding and has been a danger since the earliest times. According to Al-Kurd\u012b, there had been 89 historic floods by 1965, including several in the period. In the last century the most severe one occurred in 1942. Since then, dams have been constructed to ameliorate the problem.  Question: What is the average summer temperature in Mecca?
