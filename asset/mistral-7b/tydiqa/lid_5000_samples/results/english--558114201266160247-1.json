Passage: The Miller\u2013Urey experiment in 1952, and others since, demonstrated the synthesis of organic compounds, such as amino acids, formaldehyde and sugars, from the original inorganic precursors the researchers presumed to have been present in the primordial soup (but is no longer considered likely). This experiment inspired many others. In 1961, Joan Or\u00f3 found that the nucleotide base adenine could be made from hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and ammonia in a water solution.[6] Experiments conducted later showed that the other RNA and DNA nucleobases could be obtained through simulated prebiotic chemistry with a reducing atmosphere.[7] Question: When was the theory of RNA announced?
