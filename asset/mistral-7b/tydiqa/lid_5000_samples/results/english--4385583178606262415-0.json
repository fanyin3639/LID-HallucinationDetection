        "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Typhoon Tip, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Warling, was the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded. The forty-third tropical depression, nineteenth tropical storm, and twelfth typhoon of the 1979 Pacific typhoon season, Tip developed out of a disturbance from the monsoon trough on October4 near Pohnpei. Initially, a tropical storm to the northwest hindered the development and motion of Tip, though after the storm tracked farther north, Tip was able to intensify. After passing Guam, Tip rapidly intensified and reached peak sustained winds of 305km/h (190mph)[nb 1] and a worldwide record-low sea-level pressure of 870mbar (870.0hPa; 25.69inHg) on October12. At its peak strength, it was also the second-largest tropical cyclone on record, with a wind diameter of 2,220km (1,380mi), behind only Typhoon Winnie in 1997.[1] Tip slowly weakened as it continued west-northwestward and later turned to the northeast, in response to an approaching trough. The typhoon made landfall in southern Japan on October19, and became an extratropical cyclone shortly thereafter. Question: What was  the biggest typhoon? Answer: Typhoon Tip.",
