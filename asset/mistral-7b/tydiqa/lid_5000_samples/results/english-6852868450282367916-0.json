The day falls in late March or in April of the Gregorian calendar and the Passover lasts for 7 days in Israel and 8 days outside Israel. Jews generally observe one or two seders: in Israel, one seder is observed on the first night of Passover; many Diaspora communities hold a seder also on the second night.

This story is in the Book of Exodus (Shemot) in The Hebrew Bible.  The Seder itself is based on the Biblical verse commanding Jews to retell the story of the Exodus from Egypt: \"You shall tell your child on that day, saying, 'It is because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.'\" (Exodus 13:8) Traditionally, families and friends gather in the evening to read the text of the Haggadah, an ancient work derived from the Mishnah (Pesahim 10).[1][2] The Haggadah contains the narrative of the Israelite exodus from Egypt, special blessings and rituals, commentaries from the Talmud, and special Passover songs.
