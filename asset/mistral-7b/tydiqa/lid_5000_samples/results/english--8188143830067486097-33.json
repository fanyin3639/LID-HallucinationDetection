        "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The battle was a considerable Anglo-French victory and as no tanks were used in the initial Fourth Army attack, a continuous creeping barrage was maintained.[53] The objective of one German trench system, the original third line, which was less well-developed than the German defences on 15 September, was subjected to 40 percent greater weight of shellfire. Rainfall from 16\u201322 September and the tempo of attacks, made it difficult for the Germans to improve their defences. Cavalry were even able to seize some tactical objectives and infantry kept well up to the creeping bombardment, limiting losses to 5,000 men in the ten British divisions engaged.[54][55] French attacks in the south beyond Combles, made little progress against massed German artillery fire and Fayolle concluded that an extensive artillery preparation would be needed, to resuming the attack around 7\u20138 October.[56] Question: How many British troops died in the Battle of Morval?
