        "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Across the Atlantic, in Cleveland, Ohio a larger and heavily engineered machine was designed and constructed in the winter of 1887\u20131888 by Charles F. Brush,[20] this was built by his engineering company at his home and operated from 1886 until 1900.[21] The Brush wind turbine had a rotor 17 m (56 foot) in diameter and was mounted on an 18 m (60 foot) tower. Although large by today's standards, the machine was only rated at 12kW; it turned relatively slowly since it had 144 blades. The connected dynamo was used either to charge a bank of batteries or to operate up to 100 incandescent light bulbs, three arc lamps, and various motors in Brush's laboratory. The machine fell into disuse after 1900 when electricity became available from Cleveland's central stations, and was abandoned in 1908.[22] Question: Who developed the first wind turbine to create electricity?
