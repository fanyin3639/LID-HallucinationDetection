        "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: When Servius Tullius arrived at the senate-house to defend his position, Tarquinius threw him down the steps and Servius was murdered in the street by Tarquin's men. Soon after, Tullia drove her chariot over her father's body. For Livy, Tarquinius' impious refusal to permit his father-in-law's burial earned him the sobriquet Superbus (\u201carrogant\u201d or \u201cproud\u201d),[42] and Servius' death is a \"tragic crime\" (tragicum scelus), a dark episode in Rome's history and just cause for the abolition of the monarchy. Servius thus becomes the last of Rome's benevolent kings; the place of this outrage \u2013 which Livy seems to suggest as a crossroads \u2013 is known thereafter as Vicus Sceleratus (street of shame, infamy or crime).[43] His murder is parricide, the worst of all crimes. This morally justifies Tarquin's eventual expulsion and the abolition of Rome's aberrant, \"un-Roman\" monarchy. Livy's Republic is partly founded on the achievements and death of Rome's last benevolent king.[44] Question: How did Servius Tullius die? Answer: Servius Tullius was murdered by Tarquinius' men.
