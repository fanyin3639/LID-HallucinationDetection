        "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The largest recorded egg is from a whale shark, and was 30cm \u00d714cm \u00d79cm (11.8in \u00d75.5in \u00d73.5in) in size.[1] Whale shark eggs typically hatch within the mother. At 1.5kg (3.3lb) and up to 17.8cm \u00d714cm (7.0in \u00d75.5in), the ostrich egg is the largest egg of any living bird,[2] though the extinct elephant bird and some dinosaurs laid larger eggs. The bee hummingbird produces the smallest known bird egg, which weighs half of a gram (around 0.02oz). Some eggs laid by reptiles and most fish, amphibians, insects and other invertebrates can be even smaller. Question: What bird lays the smallest egg?
