Passage: Pararhabdodon most likely was a bipedal-quadrupedal herbivore, in the neighborhood of 6m (19.7ft) long, fully grown. The dorsal and sacral neural spines were elongate, so the animal would have had a tall back, like other hadrosaurids.  Because the material is sparse, more specific conclusions cannot be reached.[1] Question: How large was the Pararhabdodon? Answer: 6m (19.7ft) long\n\n1.
