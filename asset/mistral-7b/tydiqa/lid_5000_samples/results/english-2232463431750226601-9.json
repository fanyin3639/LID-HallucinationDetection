        "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Speeds of all-metal monoplanes of the 1930s jumped into the 700km/h (430mph) range with the Macchi M.C.72 reaching a top speed of 709km/h (441mph), still the record for piston-powered seaplanes.[13] The Messerschmitt Me 209 V1 set a world speed record of almost 756km/h (470mph) on 26 April 1939,[14] and the Republic XP-47J (a variant of the P-47 Thunderbolt) is claimed to have reached 813km/h (505mph) in testing. The P-51H, 555 made, could go  784km/h (487mph). The prototype of the twin-engined de Havilland Hornet (RR915) (383 built) reached 485mph (781km/h) as did a prototype Hawker Fury (LA610) when fitted with a Napier Sabre VII, and a prototype of the successor to the Supermarine Spitfire, the Supermarine Spiteful F.16 (RB518), reached 494mph (795km/h). The fastest German propeller driven aircraft to see combat in WWII was the twin-DB 603-powered Dornier Do 335 \"Pfeil\" which had a top speed of 763km/h (474mph).[15] Question: What was the fastest fighter plane used by the U.S. in World War II?
