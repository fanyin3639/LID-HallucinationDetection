        "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: On 30 January 1933, the new cabinet was sworn in during a brief ceremony in Hindenburg's office. The NSDAP gained three posts: Hitler was named chancellor, Wilhelm Frick Minister of the Interior, and Hermann G\u00f6ring, Minister Without Portfolio (and Minister of the Interior for Prussia).[71][72] The SA and SS led torchlit parades throughout Berlin. It is this event that would become termed Hitler's Machtergreifung (\"seizure of power\"). The term was originally used by some Nazis to suggest a revolutionary process,[73] though Hitler, and others, used the word Macht\u00fcbernahme (\"take-over of power\"), reflecting that the transfer of power took place within the existing constitutional framework[73] and suggesting that the process was legal.[74][75] Question: What day did Hitler take office?
