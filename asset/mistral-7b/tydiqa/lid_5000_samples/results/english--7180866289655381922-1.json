        "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Serge was born in Brussels, Belgium, to a couple of impoverished Russian anti-Czarist exiles. His father, Leo (Lev) Kibalchich, a former infantry trooper from Kiev, has been variously described as a distant relative[1] or a cousin[2] of Nikolai Kibalchich of the People's Will revolutionary organization, who was executed on a charge of being responsible for the bomb used in the assassination of Alexander II in 1881.  Leo, himself a Peoples' Will sympathiser, had fled Russia around 1887 and gone to Switzerland, where he met Serge's mother, Vera Frolova, n\u00e9e Pederowska. She was the daughter of an impoverished petty nobleman of Polish extraction from the Nizhni-Novgorod province. Vera had married a Saint Petersburg official and, after giving birth to two daughters, had received permission to go to Switzerland to study and heal her consumptive lungs, but also to escape the reactionary environment of Saint Petersburg. She fell in love with the handsome, feckless Kibalchich, and the couple wandered Europe, according to their son, \"in search of cheap lodgings and good libraries\". Victor was born \"by chance\" in Brussels, where the couple were so poor that Victor's younger brother died of malnutrition before Leonid eventually found work as a teacher at the Institute of Anatomy.  The \"Kibalchich myth\" of revolutionary idealism and sacrifice dominated Victor's impoverished childhood. He read a great deal, and became interested in socialism and anarchism along with his friends, including Raymond Callemin and Jean de Bo\u00eb. Question: Where was Victor Serge born?
