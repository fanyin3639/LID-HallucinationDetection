        "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The Sixth Panzer Army was unable to break through and take its immediate objectives on the Meuse River. The stubborn American resistance forced Kampfgruppe Peiper to choose an alternative route well south of Monschau and Elsenborn Ridge. As a result, the German forces were strung out over miles of winding, single-track roads, unable to concentrate their armored units. Peiper's units were repeatedly stymied by U.S. Army engineers, who blew essential bridges along their route of advance. One column of roughly 40 tanks and support vehicles was destroyed on 17 December when they were discovered by an L4 air observer of the 62nd Armored Field Artillery Battalion, assigned to the 102nd Cavalry Group. They were attacked by the 62nd's 105 howitzers mounted on M7 SP's, Corps 155's and Army 240's.[4]:410\u2013411 The panzers finally reached the Ambl\u00e8ve River, only about halfway to the Meuse River, but ran out of fuel. Food and ammunition also ran low.  After 10 days, the German forces had been reduced to an ineffective strength and withdrew. The Americans lost about 5,000 men; while exact German losses are not known, they included significant amounts of armor. While the Americans had considerable supplies and enough troops to re-equip their forces, German losses could not be replaced. Question: How many died during The Battle of Elsenborn Ridge?
