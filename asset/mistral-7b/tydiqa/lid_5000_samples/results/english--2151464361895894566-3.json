        "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The Peace Candle has undergone several changes and variations over the last 58 years.[9] The current candle was built in 1990,[10] and is expected to last until about 2014, after which time Easton officials expect to build a new one.[4][5] As of 2009, the central main candle stands 94-foot (29m), and the base brings it to about 106-foot (32m).[9] It reaches a height of about 118-foot (36m) above ground level when factoring the monument it rests atop.[8] When the candle is assembled, several 8-foot (2.4m) by 8-foot by 10-foot (3.0m) box pieces are placed around the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument, a Civil War memorial in Centre Square, the town square of Easton's Downtown neighborhood.[9] Made from marine-grade plywood and galvanized steel,[5] the box pieces are stacked vertically until the structure is assembled, and then bolted together using about 500 bolts inside the Peace Candle. The flame placed atop the candle is about 15-foot (4.6m) high and illuminated with 31 bulbs. The entire structure weighs between eight and 10 tons. The main candle is surrounded by four, 15-foot (4.6m) high side candles, and a fountain that surrounds the Peace Candle's base is filled with a ring of Christmas trees.[9] Question: What is the Peace Candle made out of?
