The result was that the patent was awarded to Bell.[5] 7 March 1876: Bell's U.S. Patent, No. 174,465 for the telephone is granted. 10 March 1876: Bell first successfully transmits speech, saying \"Mr. Watson, come here! I want to see you!\" using a liquid transmitter as described in Gray's caveat, and Bell's own electromagnetic receiver. 16 May 1876: Thomas Edison files first patent application for acoustic telegraphy for which U.S. patent 182,996 was granted October 10, 1876. 25 June 1876: Bell exhibits his telephone at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, where it draws enthusiastic reactions from Emperor Dom Pedro II of Brazil and Lord Kelvin, attracting the attention of the press and resulting in the first announcements of the invention to the general public. 10 August 1876: Alexander Graham Bell makes the world's first long-distance telephone call, over a distance of about 6 miles, between Brantford and Paris, Ontario, Canada. 1876: Hungarian Tivadar Puskas invents the telephone switchboard exchange (later working with Edison). 9 October 1876: Bell makes the first two-way long-distance telephone call between Cambridge and Boston, Massachusetts. October 1876: Edison tests his first carbon microphone. 1877: The first experimental Telephone Exchange in Boston. 20 January 1877: Edison \"first [succeeds] in transmitting over wires many articulated sentences\" using carbon granules as a pressure-sensitive varying resistance under the pressure of a diaphragm.[6] 30 January 1877: Bell's U.S. Patent No. 186,787 is granted for an electromagnetic telephone using permanent magnets, iron diaphragms, and a call bell. 4 March 1877: Emile Berliner invents a microphone based on \"loose contact\" between two metal electrodes, an improvement on Reis' Telephone, and in April 1877 files a caveat of an invention in process. April 1877: A telephone line connects the workshop of Charles Williams, Jr., located in Boston, to his house in Somerville, Massachusetts at 109 Court Street in Boston, where Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Watson had previously experimented with their telephone. The telephones became No. 1 and 2 in the Bell Telephone Company.[7] 27 April 1877: Edison files telephone patent applications. U.S. patents (Nos. 474,230, 474,231 and 474,232) were awarded to Edison in 1892 over the competing claims of Alexander Graham Bell, Emile Berliner, Elisha Gray, Amos Dolbear, J.W. McDonagh, G.B. Richmond, W.L.W. Voeker, J.H. Irwin and Francis Blake Jr.[8] Edison's carbon microphone, which he called the \"carbon transmitter\", was a great improvement over the liquid transmitter. It was the first practical microphone and was used for more than 60 years. 1877: The first commercial telephone exchange in New Haven, Connecticut. ",
