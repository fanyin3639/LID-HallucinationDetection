Passage: The term 'magnetic field' is used for two distinct but closely related fields denoted by the symbols B and H. In the International System of Units, H is measured in units of amperes per meter and B is measured in teslas, which are equivalent to newtons per meter per ampere.  H and B differ in how they account for magnetization. In a vacuum, B and H are the same aside from units; but in a magnetized material, B/     \u03bc  0     {\\displaystyle \\mu _{0}}   and H differ by the magnetization M of the material at that point in the material.
