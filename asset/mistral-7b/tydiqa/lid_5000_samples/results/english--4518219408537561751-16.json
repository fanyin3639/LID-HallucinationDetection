        "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The total population was estimated in 2009 to be at around 595,000 adult birds, in 46 known colonies spread around the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic; around 35% of the known population lives north of the Antarctic Circle. Major breeding colonies were located at Cape Washington, Coulman Island in Victoria Land, Halley, Cape Colbeck, and Dibble Glacier.[41] Colonies are known to fluctuate over time, often breaking into \"suburbs\" which move apart from the parent group, and some have been known to disappear entirely.[4] The Cape Crozier colony on the Ross Sea shrank drastically between the first visits by the Discovery Expedition in 1902\u201303[2] and the later visits by the Terra Nova Expedition in 1910\u201311; it was reduced to a few hundred birds, and may have come close to extinction due to changes in the position of the ice shelf.[42] By the 1960s it had rebounded dramatically,[42] but by 2009 was again reduced to a small population of around 300.[41] Question: What is the population of emperor penguins in Antarctica?
