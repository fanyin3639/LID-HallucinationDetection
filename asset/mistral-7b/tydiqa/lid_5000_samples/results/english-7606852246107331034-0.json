        "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Hardness is a measure of the resistance to localized plastic deformation induced by either mechanical indentation or abrasion. Some materials (e.g. metals) are harder than others (e.g. plastics, wood). Macroscopic hardness is generally characterized by strong intermolecular bonds, but the behavior of solid materials under force is complex; therefore, there are different measurements of hardness: scratch hardness, indentation hardness, and rebound hardness. Question: How is hardness determined? Answer: Hardness is determined by the strength of intermolecular bonds.\n\nAnswer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage.
