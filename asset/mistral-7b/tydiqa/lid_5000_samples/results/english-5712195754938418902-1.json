        "In 1897, Fessenden patented a new method for generating alternating current, a method that was widely used in the early days of electric power generation. The method involved the use of a rotating magnetic field, which allowed for the generation of alternating current without the need for a commutator",

        "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Fessenden is best known for his pioneering work developing radio technology, including the foundations of amplitude modulation (AM) radio. His achievements included the first transmission of speech by radio (1900), and the first two-way radiotelegraphic communication across the Atlantic Ocean (1906). In 1932 he reported that, in late 1906, he also made the first radio broadcast of entertainment and music, although a lack of verifiable details has led to some doubts about this claim.
