        "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Julius Caesar Chappelle was born into slavery in 1852 at Chappelle's Landing, a plantation near Edgefield, Newberry County, South Carolina, to an enslaved mother. He was classified as a \"mulatto,\" visibly of mixed race, with African-European ancestry.[5] Among his siblings were brothers Lewis and Mitchell. This upland area was developed for cotton cultivation in antebellum era after the invention of the cotton gin made short-staple cotton profitable. Edgefield also was known for its potteries. South Carolina has been documented as having some of the worst conditions for slaves during the time period of slavery in America, and its population was majority black from before the American Revolution into the early 20th century.  During slavery, it was often common for plantation owners to break up families and move them to different plantations of the same owner in order to stop possible uprisings.  There is evidence that during very early childhood Julius C. Chappelle and at least one of his brothers may have been moved from South Carolina to two other plantations in different states before being brought back to the South Carolina plantations in Newberry County, South Carolina.[6] Question: On what plantation was Julius Caesar Chappelle a slave? Answer: Chappelle's Landing, a plantation near Edgefield, Newberry County, South Carolina.\n\n\u00a9 BrainMass Inc. brainmass.com October 10, 2019, 5:47 am ad1c9bdddf\nhttps://brainmass",
