The breed has powerful overall conformation and good bone structure, with what is sometimes called a \"Baroque\" body type. Friesians have long, arched necks and well-chiseled, short-eared, \"Spanish-type\" heads. They have powerful, sloping shoulders, compact, muscular bodies with strong, sloping hindquarters and low-set tails. Their limbs are comparatively short and strong. A Friesian horse also has a long, thick mane and tail, often wavy, and \"feather\"\u2014long, silky hair on the lower legs\u2014deliberately left untrimmed.  The breed is known for a brisk, high-stepping trot. The Friesian is considered willing, active, and energetic, but also gentle and docile. A Friesian tends to have great presence and to carry itself with elegance.[4] Today, there are two distinct conformation types\u2014the \"baroque\" type, which has the more robust build of the classical Friesian, and the modern, \"sport horse\" type, which is finer-boned. Both types are common, though the modern type is currently more popular in the show ring than is the baroque Friesian. However, conformation type is considered less important than correct movement.[5] Question: How tall are Fresian horses? Answer: 15.3 hands (63 inches, 160 cm) tall.",
