        "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien premiered on June 1, 2009, with The Max Weinberg 7 now expanded to eight and referred to as Max Weinberg and the Tonight Show Band.  Andy Richter was back as an announcer,[82] making Weinberg's role as a foil a little uncertain.  Gradually Weinberg and the band's roles in the comic aspects of the show began to assert themselves.[87] On June 25, Weinberg departed The Tonight Show temporarily for four weeks to join Springsteen and band part-way through their European leg; this was conveyed on the show via a comedy bit that had his drum riser turn into a float that took him outside the studio and purportedly to the airport.  Weinberg returned to the show on August 3, after flying back from a Springsteen show that had ended early into the same morning in Spain.  Of being Tonight Show bandleader, he said, \"I think one of the biggest thrills in my life was seeing my name in the same sentence as Doc Severinsen, who, in my view, is the gold standard for 'Tonight Show' bandleaders. There's never been anyone who did it quite near the class and the brilliance of Doc Severinsen in the original Tonight Show Band. I used to think when I was a kid what a great job that must be \u2013 you know, same place, every time, everyday. Lo and behold, here I am 40 years later, doing it. That sounds deep, deep, deep, deep, deeply satisfying to me.\"[12] On September 25, Weinberg left The Tonight Show again for two months, to join Springsteen and band for the final, American portion of the Working on a Dream Tour.  The same drum-riser-to-float comedy bit was used, except this time the float was \"hit\" and demolished by a truck just outside the studio (and airing of the segment was delayed a few days due to O'Brien legitimately injuring himself during the same show).  The tour wrapped on November 22, 2009, in Buffalo, New York; Weinberg was back on The Tonight Show the next day.  With no E Street Band projects in sight for at least the next year or two,[88] Weinberg was left to concentrate on his bandleader role. Question: How many members were in the band led by Max Weinberg on Late Night with Conan O'Brien? Answer: 7.",
