        "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: On 7 January 1610, Galileo observed with his telescope what he described at the time as \"three fixed stars, totally invisible[lower-alpha 3] by their smallness\", all close to Jupiter, and lying on a straight line through it.[112] Observations on subsequent nights showed that the positions of these \"stars\" relative to Jupiter were changing in a way that would have been inexplicable if they had really been fixed stars. On 10 January, Galileo noted that one of them had disappeared, an observation which he attributed to its being hidden behind Jupiter. Within a few days, he concluded that they were orbiting Jupiter:[113] he had discovered three of Jupiter's four largest moons. He discovered the fourth on 13 January. Galileo named the group of four the Medicean stars, in honour of his future patron, Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Cosimo's three brothers.[114] Later astronomers, however, renamed them Galilean satellites in honour of their discoverer. These satellites were independently discovered by Simon Marius on 8 January 1610 and are now called Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto the names given by Marius in his Mundus Iovialis published in 1614.[115] Question: Who were Galileo's contemporaries? Answer: Simon Marius was Galileo's contemporary.\n\n\u00a9 BrainMass Inc. brainmass.com October 10, 2019, 1:10 am ad1c9bdddf\nhttps://brainmass.com/history/renaissance/galileo",
