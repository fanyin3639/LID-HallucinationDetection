        "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Basketball courts come in different sizes. In the National Basketball Association (NBA), the court is 94 by 50 feet (28.7 by 15.2m). Under International Basketball Federation (FIBA) rules,[1] the court is slightly smaller, measuring exactly 28 by 15 meters (91.9 by 49.2ft). In amateur basketball, court sizes vary widely. The baskets are always 10 feet (3.05m) above the floor (except possibly in youth competition). Basketball courts have a three-point arc at both baskets. A basket made from behind this arc is worth three points; a basket made from within this line, or with a player's foot touching the line, is worth 2 points. The free-throw line, where one stands while taking a foul shot, is located within the three-point arc at 15 feet from the basket. A foul shot is worth 1 point, but if a shot is made from the foul line while in play it is still worth 2 points.[2] Question: How long is a standard basketball court?
