        "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Digestive enzymes are a group of enzymes that break down polymeric macromolecules into their smaller building blocks, in order to facilitate their absorption by the body. Digestive enzymes are found in the digestive tracts of animals (including humans) and in the traps of carnivorous plants, where they aid in the digestion of food, as well as inside cells, especially in their lysosomes, where they function to maintain cellular survival. Digestive enzymes of diverse specificities are found in the saliva secreted by the salivary glands, in the secretions of cells lining  Question: Where are digestive enzymes found in the body? Answer: In the saliva secreted by the salivary glands, in the secretions of cells lining the digestive tracts of animals (including humans) and in the traps of carnivorous plants.\n\n### \"Get 15% discount on your first 3 orders with us\"",
