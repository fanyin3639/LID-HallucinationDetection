Passage: Farm-to-table (or farm-to-fork, and in some cases farm-to-school) is a social movement which promotes serving local food at restaurants and school cafeterias, preferably through direct acquisition from the producer (which might be a winery, brewery, ranch, fishery, or other type of food producer which is not strictly a \"farm\").

Often restaurants cannot source all the food they need for dishes locally, so only some dishes or only some ingredients are labelled as local. Question: What is farm to table dining?
