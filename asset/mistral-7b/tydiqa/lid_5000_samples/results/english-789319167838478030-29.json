        "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Distribution rights for the United States were picked up at Sundance by IFC Films.[40] Trinity Filmed Entertainment was the British distributor.[41] The film was released in the United States and the United Kingdom on 24 September 2010.[42][43] In both these countries, the film was distributed without the seventh of its nine reels. The running time was therefore 137 minutes at 25 frames per second, which the director had instructed that the film should be played at, or 142 minutes at the more common 24 frames per second.[41][44] No\u00e9 says that none of the cut material is essential for the film. He describes it as \"some astro-visions, an orgy scene with Linda and the Japanese girl, the scene where you see [Oscar] waking up at the morgue and he thinks he's alive but he's not, and then the camera goes down the plughole where she's tipping his ashes.\"[10] The reason the shorter version was made was that No\u00e9 had promised the investors to make an alternative edit if the film ended up being longer than two hours and 20 minutes.[45] The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in France on 1 December 2010. Each edition features both the complete version and the shorter cut.[30][46] Question: What was the running time of the film Enter the Void? Answer: 137 minutes at 25 frames per second, which the director had instructed that the film should be played at, or 142 minutes at the more common 25 frames per second.",
