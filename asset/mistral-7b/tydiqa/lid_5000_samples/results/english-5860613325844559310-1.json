Passage: Construction began in 1459, ordered by Mehmed the Conqueror, six years after the conquest of Constantinople.

It was given the name Topkap\u0131, meaning Cannon Gate, in the 19th century.[5] The complex was expanded over the centuries, with major renovations after the 1509 earthquake and the 1665 fire.
