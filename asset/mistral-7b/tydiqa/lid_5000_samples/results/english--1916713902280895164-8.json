        "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Initially, cowboy commercials involving the Marlboro Man featured paid models, such as William Thourlby,[17] pretending to carry out cowboy tasks.  However, Burnett felt that the commercials lacked authenticity, as it was apparent that the subjects were not real cowboys and did not have the desired rugged look.  One of the finest was a non-smoking rodeo cowboy, Max Bryan \"Turk\" Robinson, who was recruited at a rodeo. Leo Burnett was not satisfied with the cowboy actors found. Broadway and MGM movie actor Christian Haren won the role as the first Marlboro Man in the early 1960s as he looked the part. Burnett then came across Darrell Winfield, who worked on a ranch, after a Cattle Rancher by the name Keith Alexander declined the role because he did not believe in smoking.  Leo Burnett\u2019s creative director was awed when he first saw Winfield: \"I had seen cowboys, but I had never seen one that just really, like, he sort of scared the hell out of me (as he was so much a real cowboy).\"  Winfield\u2019s immediate authenticity led to his 20-year run as the Marlboro Man, which lasted until the late 1980s. Upon Winfield\u2019s retirement, Philip Morris reportedly spent $300 million searching for a new Marlboro Man.[18][19] Question: Who played the original Marlboro Man?
