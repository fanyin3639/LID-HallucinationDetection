Passage: Rajamouli started directing Telugu soap operas on Eenadu Television, under the guidance of K. Raghavendra Rao. Later on, he directed Santhi Nivasam TV Serial which was produced by K. Raghavendra Rao.[22] His first shot at Telugu films was Student No.1, with Jr. NTR in 2001. It took two years for Rajamouli to come up with his second movie Simhadri. In the two-year gap between Student No.1 and Simhadri, Rajamouli planned his first mythological film with Malayalam actor Mohanlal, but the film eventually got shelved.[24] In 2015, Assistant art director Manu Jagath, who later worked as the art director for Baahubali, released several sketches he had drawn for the shelved Mohanlal project.[25] Rajamouli's third movie was Sye, with actors Nithin and Genelia D'Souza. It was a first-of-its-kind movie in Tollywood, in that it was based on a rugby game. This movie was also the first instance where Rajamouli collaborated with K. K. Senthil Kumar.[26] His next was Chatrapathi, with the music of M. M. Keeravani and cinematography by Senthil Kumar. Question: What was S. S. Rajamouli's first film? Answer: Student No.1 was S. S.
