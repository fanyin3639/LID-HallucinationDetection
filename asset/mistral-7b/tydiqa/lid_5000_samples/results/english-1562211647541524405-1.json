        "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Iraq's Muslims follow two distinct traditions, Shia and Sunni Islam. According to the 2018 CIA Factbook, Iraq is 95% Muslim: 64\u201369% Shia (Arabs, Feyli Kurds et al.) and 29\u201334% Sunni (Arabs and Kurds). The overall percentage of Muslims has increased since the Iraqi Civil War (2014\u20132017) due to the migration of Christian and Yezidi refugees into neighboring countries.[2] A 2011 Pew Research Center Survey found that Iraqi Muslims are 51% Shia, 42% Sunni, and 5% described themselves as \"Just a Muslim\".[3] Iraq is home to many religious sites important for both Shia and Sunni Muslims. Baghdad was a hub of Islamic learning and scholarship for centuries and served as the capital of the Abassids. The city of Karbala has substantial prominence in Shia Islam as a result of the Battle of Karbala, fought on the site of the modern city on October 10, 680. Similarly, Najaf is renowned as the site of the tomb of Al\u012b ibn Ab\u012b T\u0101lib (also known as \"Im\u0101m Al\u012b\"), whom the Shia consider to be the righteous caliph and first im\u0101m. The city is now a great center of pilgrimage from throughout the Shi'a Islamic world and it is estimated that only Mecca and Medina receive more Muslim pilgrims. The city of Kufa was home to the famed Sunni scholar Abu Hanifah, whose school of thought is followed by a sizable number of Sunni Muslims across the globe. Likewise, Samarra is also home to the al-Askari Mosque, containing the mausoleums of the Ali al-Hadi and Hasan al-Askari, the tenth and eleventh Shia Imams, respectively, as well as the shrine of Muhammad al-Mahdi, known as the \"Hidden Imam\", who is the twelfth and final Imam of the Shia of the Ja'far\u012b Madhhab. This has made it an important pilgrimage centre for Ja'far\u012b Shia Muslims. In addition, some female relatives of the Prophet Mohammad are buried in Samarra, making the city one of the most significant sites of worship for Shia and a venerated location for Sunni Muslims. Question: What is the main version of Islam practiced in Iraq?
