Passage: Charlie Brown (also known as Charles Brown, Esq. and nicknamed Chuck by Peppermint Patty) is the lead role of the comic strip Peanuts, syndicated in daily and Sunday newspapers in numerous countries all over the world.

He is easily recognized by his trademark zigzag patterned shirt. There is only one exception:  whenever he's a costumed character, he wears a red baseball cap on top of his head most of the time, rather than just wearing a white one during baseball seasons in comic strips and animation.
