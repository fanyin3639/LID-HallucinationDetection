        "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Spontaneous recovery is a phenomenon of learning and memory that was first named and described by Ivan Pavlov in his studies of classical (Pavlovian) conditioning. In that context, it refers to the re-emergence of a previously extinguished conditioned response after a delay.[1] Such a recovery of \"lost\" behaviors can be observed within a variety of domains, and the recovery of lost human memories is often of particular interest.[2] For a mathematical model for spontaneous recovery see Further Reading. Question: What can we learn with Spontaneous recovery? Answer: Spontaneous recovery is a phenomenon of learning and memory that was first named and described by Ivan Pavlov in his studies of classical (Pavlovian) conditioning. In that context, it refers to the re-emergence of a previously extinguished conditioned response after a delay.[1]",
