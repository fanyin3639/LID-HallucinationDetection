        "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Female moths lay one brood per season, and eggs are laid over several days. The number of eggs per egg mass varies from 1 to about 60, but there are 20 eggs on average per mass.[10] These masses are laid in 2 to 4 rows on conifer foliage, preferably balsam fir and spruce needles. Generally, females can lay 100 to 300 eggs in a lifetime but average approximately 200 eggs. These eggs hatch after around 10 days, but this period ranges from 8 to 12 days.[28][34] The spruce budworm oviposits on needles of host trees in late June or mid-July to early August.[35] Large numbers of egg masses are deposited on the peripheral shoots of the crown.[10] Question: How many eggs does the eastern spruce budworm lay?
