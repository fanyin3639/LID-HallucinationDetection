        "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Post-analysis on Andrew revealed that the storm was often stronger than operationally reported between early on August 22 and early on August 26. In real time, the National Hurricane Center assessed its peak intensity as 150mph (240km/h),[15] which was upgraded to 155mph (250km/h) in a post-storm analysis after the season ended.[2] However, a 2004 paper by Christopher Landsea and others concluded that Andrew became a Category 5 hurricane near the Bahamas on August 23 and reached maximum sustained winds of 175mph (280km/h). The paper also indicated that Andrew briefly re-intensified into a Category 5 hurricane around the time of landfall in South Florida early on August 24. The storm was found to have been slightly stronger while approaching Louisiana, but the landfall winds were decreased from 120mph (195km/h) to 115mph (185km/h).[8] Question: When did Hurricane Andrew make landfall in Florida?
