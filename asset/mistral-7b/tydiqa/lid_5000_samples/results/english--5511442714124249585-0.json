        "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Oklahoma City lies in a temperate humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa), with frequent variations in weather daily and seasonally, except during the consistently hot and humid summer months. Consistent winds, usually from the south or south-southeast during the summer, help temper the hotter weather. Consistent northerly winds during the winter can intensify cold periods. Oklahoma City's climate transitions toward semi-arid further to the west, toward humid continental to the north, and toward humid subtropical to the east and southeast. The normal annual mean temperature is 61.4\u00b0F (16.3\u00b0C); the coolest year was 1895 with a mean of 57.9\u00b0F (14.4\u00b0C), while the warmest 2012 at 64.1\u00b0F (17.8\u00b0C). Precipitation averages 36.52 inches (928mm) annually, falling on an average 84 days, with the warmer months receiving more; annual precipitation has historically ranged from 15.74in (400mm) in 1901 to 56.95in (1,447mm) in 2007.[1] The sun shines about 69% of the time, with monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 60% in December to 80% in July.[2] Question: What kind of weather does Oklahoma have?
