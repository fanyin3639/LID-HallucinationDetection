        "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Body odor is influenced by the actions of the skin flora, including members of Corynebacterium, which manufacture enzymes called lipases that break down the lipids in sweat to create smaller molecules like butyric acid. Greater bacteria populations of Corynebacterium jeikeium are for example found more in the armpits of men whereas greater population numbers of Staphylococcus haemolyticus are found in the armpits of women. This causes male armpits to give off of a rancid/cheese-like smell whereas female armpits give off a more fruity/onion-like smell.[7] Staphylococcus hominis is also known for producing thioalcohol compounds that contribute to odors.[8] These smaller molecules smell, and give body odor its characteristic aroma.[9] Propionic acid (propanoic acid) is present in many sweat samples. This acid is a breakdown product of some amino acids by propionibacteria, which thrive in the ducts of adolescent and adult sebaceous glands. Because propionic acid is chemically similar to acetic acid with similar characteristics including odor, body odors may be identified as having a vinegar-like smell by certain people. Isovaleric acid (3-methyl butanoic acid) is the other source of body odor as a result of actions of the bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis,[10] which is also present in several strong cheese types. Question: What bacteria are responsible for smelly body odor? Answer: Corynebacterium and Staphylococcus are responsible for smelly body odor.",
