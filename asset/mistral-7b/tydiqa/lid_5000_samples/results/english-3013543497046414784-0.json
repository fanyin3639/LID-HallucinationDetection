        "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The lux (symbol: lx) is the SI derived unit of illuminance and luminous emittance, measuring luminous flux per unit area.[1] It is equal to one lumen per square metre. In photometry, this is used as a measure of the intensity, as perceived by the human eye, of light that hits or passes through a surface. It is analogous to the radiometric unit watt per square metre, but with the power at each wavelength weighted according to the luminosity function, a standardized model of human visual brightness perception. In English, \"lux\" is used as both the singular and plural form.[2] Question: What is the unit of measurement for light brightness?
