Passage: Manon Lescaut premiered at the Teatro Regio in Turin on 2 February 1893.[10] By coincidence, Puccini's first enduringly popular opera appeared within a week of the premiere of Verdi's last opera, Falstaff, which was first performed on 9 February 1893.[10] In anticipation of the premiere, La Stampa wrote that Puccini was a young man concerning whom \"great hopes\" had a real basis (\"un giovane che e tra i pochi sul quale le larghe speranze non siano benigne illusioni\").[10] Because of the failure of Edgar, however, a failure of Manon Lescaut could have jeopardized Puccini's future as a composer.
