        "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: John Part (born June 29, 1966) is a Canadian professional darts player and commentator, nicknamed Darth Maple. Part is a three-times World Champion, having won the 1994 BDO World Darts Championship, and the PDC World Championship in 2003 and 2008. He is statistically North America's greatest darts player to date.[2] He has the distinction of being the first non-UK player to win the World Championship, and the only non-European to date to win the PDC World Darts Championship. His first Championship was the second time a non-seeded player won the BDO World Darts Championship, and one of the few times where a player only lost one set in the entire tournament. His nine year gap between his first and second World Championships is tied with Ted Hankey for the longest gap between World Championships, and his third triumph in 2008 saw him become the first player in history to win a world title in three different venues, and the first to win at the Alexandra Palace. His 2008 win saw him join Phil Taylor, Eric Bristow, Raymond van Barneveld and John Lowe as the only players with three or more World Championships, and become only the second player (after Taylor) to win multiple PDC titles. His eleven televised PDC finals is tied with Dennis Priestley for the eighth most all time, and his \u00a3874,151 in prize money to date is the sixteenth highest amount in PDC history. Question: How old is John Part? Answer: 51 years old.",
