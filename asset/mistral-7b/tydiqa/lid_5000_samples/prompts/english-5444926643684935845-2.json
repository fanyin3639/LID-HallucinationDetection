    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The height of the tower is 55.86 metres (183.27 feet) from the ground on the low side and 56.67 metres (185.93 feet) on the high side. The width of the walls at the base is 2.44m (8ft 0.06in). Its weight is estimated at 14,500 metric tons (16,000 short tons).[1] The tower has 296 or 294 steps; the seventh floor has two fewer steps on the north-facing staircase. In 1990 the tower leaned at an angle of 5.5 degrees,[2][3][4] but following remedial work between 1993 and 2001 this was reduced to 3.97 degrees,[5] reducing the overhang by 45cm at a cost of \u00a3200m.[6] It lost a further 4cm of tilt in the two decades to 2018. Question: What is the angle of the Leaning Tower of Pisa? Answer:",
