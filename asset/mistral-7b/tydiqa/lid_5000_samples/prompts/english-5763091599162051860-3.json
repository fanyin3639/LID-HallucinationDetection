    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: New York City is the most populous city in the United States, with an estimated 8,491,079 people living in the city, according to U.S. Census estimates dating July 1, 2014[18] (up from  8,175,133 in 2010; 8.0 million in 2000; and 7.3 million in 1990).[17] This amounts to about 40% of New York State's population and a similar percentage of the metropolitan regional population. New York's two key demographic features are its population density and cultural diversity. The city's population density of 26,403 people per square mile (10,194/km\u00b2), makes it the densest of any American municipality with a population above 100,000.[19] Manhattan's population density is 66,940 people per square mile (25,846/km\u00b2), highest of any county in the United States.[20][21] Question: What is the population density of NYC?
