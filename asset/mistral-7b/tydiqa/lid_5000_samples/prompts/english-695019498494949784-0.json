Passage: A shipyard (also called a dockyard) is a place where ships are built and repaired.  These can be yachts, military vessels, cruise liners or other cargo or passenger ships.

The terms are routinely used interchangeably, in part because the evolution of dockyards and shipyards has often caused them to change or merge roles. Question: What does a shipyard do? Answer:",
