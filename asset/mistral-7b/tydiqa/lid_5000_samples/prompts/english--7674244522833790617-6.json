    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The first asteroid to be discovered, Ceres, was originally considered to be a new planet.[note 1] This was followed by the discovery of other similar bodies, which, with the equipment of the time, appeared to be points of light, like stars, showing little or no planetary disc, though readily distinguishable from stars due to their apparent motions. This prompted the astronomer Sir William Herschel to propose the term \"asteroid\",[note 2] coined in Greek as \u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03ae\u03c2, or asteroeid\u0113s, meaning 'star-like, star-shaped', and derived from the Ancient Greek \u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1 ast\u0113r 'star, planet'. In the early second half of the nineteenth century, the terms \"asteroid\" and \"planet\" (not always qualified as \"minor\") were still used interchangeably. [note 3] Question: Who coined the term asteroid? Answer:",
