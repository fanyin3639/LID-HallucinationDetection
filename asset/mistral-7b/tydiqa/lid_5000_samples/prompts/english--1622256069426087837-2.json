    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage.

The Apito is often used by the leader to signal breaks and calls.   Other instruments have been added in many samba bands such as frigideira, 4 stringed guitars, 7 stringed guitars, trombones and Singers. A small set of samba drums in the UK costs around \u00a3300. More expensive sets come with more drums enabling more players to join; a convenience due to how many would usually take place in the orchestra.  Question: What drums are traditionally used in Samba?
