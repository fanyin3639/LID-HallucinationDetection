    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: In Medieval music, the Guidonian hand was a mnemonic device used to assist singers in learning to sight-sing. Some form of the device may have been used by Guido of Arezzo, a medieval music theorist who wrote a number of treatises, including one instructing singers in sightreading. The hand occurs in some manuscripts before Guido's time as a tool to find the semitone; it does not have the depicted form until the 12th century. Sigebertus Gemblacensis in c. 1105\u201310 did describe Guido using the joints of the hand to aid in teaching his hexachord.  The Guidonian hand is closely linked with Guido's new ideas about how to learn music, including the use of hexachords, and the first known Western use of solfege. Question: When was the Guidonian hand introduced? Answer:",
