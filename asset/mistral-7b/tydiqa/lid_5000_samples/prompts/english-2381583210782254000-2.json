    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: In 1978 Martin Marietta programmer Wayne Ratliff wrote Vulcan, a database application, to help him make picks for football pools. Written in Intel 8080 assembly language, it ran on the CP/M operating system and was modeled on JPLDIS,[1] a Univac 1108 program used at JPL and written by fellow programmer Jeb Long. Ashton-Tate was launched as a result of George Tate and Hal Lashlee having discovered Vulcan from Ratliff in 1981 and licensing it (there was never any Ashton).  The original agreement was written on one page, and called for simple, generous royalty payments to Ratliff. Question: Who founded Ashton-Tate? Answer:",
