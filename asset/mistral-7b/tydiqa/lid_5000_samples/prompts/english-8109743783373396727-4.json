    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: On 15 September 1965, as the Council was drawing to a close, Pope Paul VI established the Synod of Bishops,[11] noting that \"the Ecumenical Council ... gave Us the idea of permanently establishing a special Council of bishops, with the aim of providing for a continuance after the Council of the great abundance of benefits that We have been so happy to see flow to the Christian people during the time of the Council as a result of Our close collaboration with the bishops.\"[12] The Pope sought \"to make ever greater use of the bishops' assistance in providing for the good of the universal Church\" and to enjoy \"the consolation of their presence, the help of their wisdom and experience, the support of their counsel, and the voice of their authority.\"[12] This preempted action by the Council and made the Synod \"immediately and directly\" subject to papal authority, ensuring that it would be strictly an advisory body.[13] The Synod of the Bishops does not constitute collegial governance of the Church, but represents a collaboration with the Pope: it discusses topics proposed to it and makes recommendations, but does not settle questions or issue decrees, unless the Pope grants it deliberative power in certain cases.[14] Question: When was the first synod of Catholic bishops?
