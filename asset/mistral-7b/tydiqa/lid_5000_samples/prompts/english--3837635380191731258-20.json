    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The Inland taipan (Oxyuranus microlepidotus) is considered the most venomous snake in the world with a murine LD50 value of 0.025mg/kg SC.[6][90] Ernst and Zug et al. 1996 list a value of 0.01mg/kg SC, which makes it the most venomous snake in the world in their study too. They have an average venom yield of 44mg.[90] Bites from this species have a mortality rate of 80% if left untreated, although it is very rare for this species to bite. This species is known to be a very shy, reclusive and a laid-back snake that will nearly always slither away from disturbance. It is not an aggressive species and rarely strikes. No recorded incidents have been fatal since the advent of the monovalent (specific) antivenom therapy. Question: What is the most venomous snake in the world? Answer:",
