    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: A capacitor can store electric energy when it is connected to its charging circuit. And when it is disconnected from its charging circuit, it can dissipate that stored energy, so it can be used like a temporary battery. Capacitors are commonly used in electronic devices to maintain power supply while batteries are being changed. (This prevents  loss of information in volatile memory.) Question: What is the most common use for capacitors? Answer:",
