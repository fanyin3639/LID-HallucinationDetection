However, the themes were so harsh and dark that the show was rejected by every [Japanese] television network. Even NHK opposed it.\u201d Hashida said she was told \"We can't confront Meiji issues.\" It was settled when then-station director Mikio Kawaguchi(\u5ddd\u53e3\u5e79\u592b,Kawaguchi Mikio) gave his approval.[1] Question: Who created the TV show Oshin?
