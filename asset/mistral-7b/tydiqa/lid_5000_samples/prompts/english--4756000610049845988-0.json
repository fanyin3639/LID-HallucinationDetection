    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The Great Galveston Hurricane,[1] known regionally as the Great Storm of 1900,[2][3] was the deadliest natural disaster in United States history, one of the deadliest hurricanes (or remnants) to affect Canada, and the fourth-deadliest Atlantic hurricane overall. The hurricane left between 6,000 and 12,000fatalities in the United States; the number most cited in official reports is 8,000. Most of these deaths occurred in the vicinity of Galveston after storm surge inundated the entire island with 8 to 12 feet (2.4 to 3.7m) of water. In addition to the number killed, every house in the city sustained damage, with at least 3,636destroyed. Approximately 10,000people in the city were left homeless, out of a total population of nearly 38,000. The disaster ended the Golden Era of Galveston, as the hurricane alarmed potential investors, who turned to Houston instead. The Gulf of Mexico shoreline of Galveston island was subsequently raised by 17ft (5.2m) and a 10mi (16km) seawall erected. Question: What was the worst hurricane in history? Answer:",
