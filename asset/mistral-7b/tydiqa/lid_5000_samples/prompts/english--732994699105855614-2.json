It allowed abortion in cases of danger to the mother, and the abortion decision was taken by two doctors. 1965 \u2013 The U.S. Supreme Court case Griswold v. Connecticut struck down one of the remaining Comstock laws, the state bans on contraception. 1966 \u2013 The Ceau\u015fescu regime in Romania, in an attempt to boost the country's population, Decree 770 banned all abortion and contraception, except in very limited cases.[32] 1966 \u2013 Mississippi reformed its abortion law and became the first U.S. state to allow abortion in cases of rape. 1967 \u2013 The Abortion Act (effective 1968) legalized abortion in the United Kingdom under certain grounds (except in Northern Ireland). 1967 - In the U.S., California, Colorado, and North Carolina reformed their abortion laws based on the 1962 American Law Institute (ALI) Model Penal Code (MPC) 1968 \u2013 Georgia and Maryland reformed their abortion laws based on the ALI MPC. 1968\u2013 President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Committee on The Status of Women releases a report calling for a repeal of all abortion laws. 1969 \u2013 Arkansas, Delaware, Kansas, New Mexico and Oregon, reformed their abortion laws based on the ALI MPC. 1969\u2013 Canada passed the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968-69, which began to allow abortion for selective reasons. 1969 \u2013 The ruling in the Victorian case of R v Davidson defined for the first time which abortions are lawful in Australia.[33] Question: What was the first country to legalize abortion?
