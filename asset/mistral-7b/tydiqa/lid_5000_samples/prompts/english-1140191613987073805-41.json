Passage: City or urban blues styles were more codified and elaborate, as a performer was no longer within their local, immediate community, and had to adapt to a larger, more varied audience's aesthetic.[75] Classic female urban and vaudeville blues singers were popular in the 1920s, among them \"the big three\"\u2014Gertrude \"Ma\" Rainey, Bessie Smith, and Lucille Bogan\u2014and Victoria Spivey. Mamie Smith, more a vaudeville performer than a blues artist, was the first African American to record a blues song in 1920; her second record, \"Crazy Blues\", sold 75,000 copies in its first month.[76] Ma Rainey, the \"Mother of Blues\", and Bessie Smith each \"[sang] around center tones, perhaps in order to project her voice more easily to the back of a room\". Smith would \"sing a song in an unusual key, and her artistry in bending and stretching notes with her beautiful, powerful contralto to accommodate her own interpretation was unsurpassed\".[77] Question: What was the first blues recording ever made?
