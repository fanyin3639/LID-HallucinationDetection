    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Their first game was Safecracker, a point and click adventure game published by DreamCatcher Interactive. The game had a tumultuous production, starting when GT Interactive bought initial publisher Warner Interactive Europe.[5] Daydream Software went public in late 1996.[6][7] The company's goal was to increase its economic and decision-making freedom, and to secure the ability to select a publisher at the end of each game's development rather than at the beginning.[7] President Jans Phersson-Broburg argued that self-financing Daydream's future games with money from Swedish investors, instead of obtaining \"funding linked to specific projects\" from publishers, would offer the developer more stability, flexibility and room for growth.[8] For Daydream's public launch, roughly 20 million kr worth of shares, or 45.5% of the company, were offered to investors in Sweden.[7] The initial public offering was a success,[9] and Daydream opened on the Stockholm Stock Exchange's Stockholm B\u00f6rsinformation (SBI) list in January 1997.[10] Daydream was eventually able to buy back the rights to Safecracker. Question: What was the first game developed by Daydream Software? Answer:",
