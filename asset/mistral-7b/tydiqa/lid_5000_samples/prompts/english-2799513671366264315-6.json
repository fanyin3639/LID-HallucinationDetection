    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: According to research by Pew Research Center for the PEW-TEMPLTON Global Religion Futures Project in 2010 94.9% of Egyptians are Sunni Muslim, 5.1% are Christian, and less than 1% are Jewish, Buddhist, or other religions.[4] The share of Christians in the Egyptian population has been declining with the highest share reported in the past century being in 1927, when the official census put the percentage of Egyptian Christians at 8.3%. In each of the seven subsequent censuses, the percentage shrank, ending at 5.7% in 1996. However, most Christians refuted these figures claiming they have been undercounted.  Christians uphold that they represent up to 15 or even 20% of the Egyptian population.[5][6][7][8][9] In 2017 state-owned newspaper Al Ahram claimed that the percentage of Christians ranged from 10 to 15%[10][11][12], similar to the range claimed by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.[13] Question: What percentage of the Egyptian population is Christian?
