    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Hart attended Albany College (now Lewis & Clark College), then transferred with classmate and romantic partner Eva Cushman to Stanford University for the 1911\u20131912 school year before going back to Albany.[5] Hart graduated from Albany College in 1912, and in 1917 obtained a doctor of medicine degree from the University of Oregon Medical Department in Portland (now Oregon Health & Science University); during this period, Hart also returned to Northern California to attend courses in the summer of 1916 at the Stanford University School of Medicine, then located in San Francisco.[6] Hart was deeply unhappy that the medical degree was issued in his female name, limiting his opportunities to use it in any future life under a male name. College records show that at least one of the senior staff was sympathetic; his graduation records were indexed internally with the suffix \"(aka Robert L.), M.D.\".[7] Nonetheless, Hart knew that if he presented himself as Robert, any prospective employer checking his credentials  would discover the female name or find no records for him at all. After graduation he worked for a short while (presenting as a woman) at a Red Cross hospital in Philadelphia. Question: When did Alan L. Hart graduate? Answer:",
