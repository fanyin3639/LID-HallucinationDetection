    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Robby Benson as Beast[11] \u2013 A young prince who is transformed into a beast by an enchantress as punishment for his arrogance. The animators drew him with the head structure and horns of an American bison, the arms and body of a bear, the ears of a deer, the eyebrows of a gorilla, the jaws, teeth, and mane of a lion, the tusks of a wild boar, and the legs and tail of a wolf. Chris Sanders, one of the film's storyboard artists, drafted the designs for the Beast and came up with designs based on birds, insects, and fish before coming up with something close to the final design. Glen Keane, supervising animator for the Beast, refined the design by going to the zoo and studying the animals on which the Beast was based.[10] Benson commented, \"There's a rage and torment in this character I've never been asked to use before.\"[14] The filmmakers commented that \"everybody was big fee-fi-fo-fum and gravelly\" while Benson had the \"big voice and the warm, accessible side\" so that \"you could hear the prince beneath the fur\".[10] Richard White as Gaston[11] \u2013 A vain hunter who vies for Belle's hand in marriage and is determined not to let anyone else win her heart. He serves as a foil personality to the Beast, who was once as egotistical as Gaston prior to his transformation. Gaston's supervising animator, Andreas Deja, was pressed by Jeffrey Katzenberg to make Gaston handsome in contrast to the traditional appearance of a Disney villain, an assignment he found difficult at first. In the beginning, Gaston is depicted as more of a narcissist than a villain, but later he leads all the villagers to kill the beast, enraged that Belle would love a Beast more than him.[15] Jerry Orbach as Lumi\u00e8re[16] \u2013 The kind-hearted but rebellious valet of the Beast's, who has been transformed into a candlestick. He has a habit of disobeying his master's strict rules, sometimes causing tension between them, but the Beast often turns to him for advice. He is depicted as flirtatious, as he is frequently seen with the Featherduster and immediately takes a liking to Belle. A running gag throughout the movie is Lumi\u00e8re burning Cogsworth. Nik Ranieri served as the supervising animator for Lumi\u00e8re. David Ogden Stiers as Cogsworth[17] \u2013 Majordomo, the head of the household staff and Lumi\u00e8re's best friend, who has been transformed into a clock. He is extremely loyal to the Beast so as to save himself and anyone else any trouble, often leading to friction between himself and Lumi\u00e8re. Will Finn served as the supervising animator for Cogsworth. Stiers also narrates the prologue. Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Potts[18] \u2013 The castle cook, turned into a teapot, who takes a motherly attitude toward Belle. The filmmakers went through several names for Mrs. Potts, such as \"Mrs. Chamomile\", before Ashman suggested the use of simple and concise names for the household objects.[10] David Pruiksma served as the supervising animator for Mrs. Potts. Bradley Pierce as Chip[19] \u2013 Mrs. Potts' son, who has been turned into a teacup. Originally intended to only have one line, the filmmakers were impressed with Pierce's performance and expanded the character's role significantly, eschewing a mute Music Box character.[10] Pruiksma also served as the supervising animator for Chip. Rex Everhart as Maurice[11] \u2013 Belle's inventor father. The villagers see him as insane for crafting devices believed impossible to construct in reality, but his loyal daughter believes he will be famous one day. Ruben A. Aquino served as the supervising animator for Maurice. Jesse Corti as Lefou[11] \u2013 Gaston's often abused yet loyal sidekick. Chris Wahl served as the supervising animator for Lefou. Hal Smith as Philippe[20] \u2013 Belle's Belgian horse. Russ Edmonds served as the supervising animator for Philippe. Jo Anne Worley as the Wardrobe[21] \u2013 The castle's authority over fashion, and a former opera singer, who has been turned into a wardrobe. The character of Wardrobe was introduced by visual development person Sue C. Nichols to the then entirely male cast of servants, and was originally a more integral character named \"Madame Armoire\". Wardrobe is known as \"Madame de la Grande Bouche\" (Madame Big Mouth) in the stage adaptation of the film and is the only major enchanted object character whose human form does not appear in the film. Tony Anselmo served as the supervising animator for the Wardrobe. Mary Kay Bergman and Kath Soucie as the Bimbettes[22] \u2013 A trio of village maidens who constantly fawn over Gaston, known as the \"Silly Girls\" in the stage adaptation. Brian Cummings as the Stove[23] \u2013 The castle's chef who has been transformed into a stove. He is named Chef Bouche in 1998's Belle's Magical World. Alvin Epstein as the Bookseller[24] \u2013 The owner of a book shop in Belle's hometown. Tony Jay as Monsieur D'Arque[25] \u2013 The sadistic warden of the Asylum de Loons. Gaston bribes him to help in his plan to blackmail Belle. Alec Murphy as the Baker[26] \u2013 The owner of a bakery in Belle's hometown. Kimmy Robertson as the Featherduster[27] \u2013 A maid and Lumi\u00e8re's sweetheart, who has been turned into a feather duster. She is unnamed in the 1991 film (listed as Featherduster in the credits); Babette is the name given to this character later in the 1994 stage adaptation of the film; Fifi in the 1998 animated musical film Belle's Magical World and Plumette in the 2017 live-action remake. Frank Welker as Sultan[28] \u2013 The castle's pet dog turned into a footstool. Question: Who voiced Lumiere in Walt Disney Pictures' animated feature film Beauty and the Beast? Answer:",
