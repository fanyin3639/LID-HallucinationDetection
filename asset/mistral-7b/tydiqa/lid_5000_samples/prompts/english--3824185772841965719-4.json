    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: In January 1933, Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany and it quickly became unsafe for Jewish scientists to remain in the country. Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd fled to London where he proposed, and in 1934 patented, the idea of a nuclear chain reaction via neutrons. The patent also introduced the term critical mass to describe the minimum amount of material required to sustain the chain reaction and its potential to cause an explosion. (British patent 630,726.) He subsequently assigned the patent to the British Admiralty so that it could be covered by the Official Secrets Act.[2] In a very real sense, Szil\u00e1rd was the father of the atomic bomb academically. Also in 1934, Ir\u00e8ne and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie discovered that artificial radioactivity could be induced in stable elements by bombarding them with alpha particles; Enrico Fermi reported similar results when bombarding uranium with neutrons. Question: When was the first nuclear weapon created? Answer:",
