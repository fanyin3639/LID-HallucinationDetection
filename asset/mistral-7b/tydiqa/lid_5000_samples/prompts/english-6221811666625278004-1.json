Passage: Before \u2013 writing about \"recipes\" (on cooking, rituals, agriculture and other sorts of themes like willa&Mayan) c. 1700\u20132000 BC \u2013 Egyptians develop earliest known algorithms for multiplying two numbers c. 1600 BC \u2013 Babylonians develop earliest known algorithms for factorization and finding square roots c. 300 BC \u2013 Euclid's algorithm c. 200 BC \u2013 the Sieve of Eratosthenes 263 AD \u2013 Gaussian elimination described by Liu Hui 628 \u2013 Chakravala method described by Brahmagupta c. 820 \u2013 Al-Khawarizmi described algorithms for solving linear equations and quadratic equations in his Algebra; the word algorithm comes from his name 825 \u2013 Al-Khawarizmi described the algorism, algorithms for using the Hindu-Arabic numeral system, in his treatise On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals, which was translated into Latin as Algoritmi de numero Indorum, where \"Algoritmi\", the translator's rendition of the author's name gave rise to the word algorithm (Latin algorithmus) with a meaning \"calculation method\" c. 850 \u2013 cryptanalysis and frequency analysis algorithms developed by Al-Kindi (Alkindus) in A Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages, which contains algorithms on breaking encryptions and ciphers[1] c. 1025 \u2013 Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen), was the first mathematician to derive the formula for the sum of the fourth powers, and in turn, he develops an algorithm for determining the general formula for the sum of any integral powers, which was fundamental to the development of integral calculus[2] c. 1400 \u2013 Ahmad al-Qalqashandi gives a list of ciphers in his Subh al-a'sha which include both substitution and transposition, and for the first time, a cipher with multiple substitutions for each plaintext letter; he also gives an exposition on and worked example of cryptanalysis, including the use of tables of letter frequencies and sets of letters which can not occur together in one word Question: Who developed the first algorithms?
