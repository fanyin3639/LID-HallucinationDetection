    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts such as Dr. William M. Gray and his associates at Colorado State University (CSU). A normal season as defined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has eleven named storms, of which six reach hurricane strength, and two major hurricanes.[4] In April 1990, it was forecast that six storms would reach hurricane status, and there would be \"three additional storms\" from the previous year, which would indicate 14 named storms. The forecast did not specify how many hurricanes would reach major hurricane status.[2] In early June 1990, CSU released their predictions of tropical cyclonic activity within the Atlantic basin during the 1990 season. The forecast from CSU called for 11 named storms, seven of which to intensify into a hurricane, and three would strengthen further into a major hurricane.[3] Question: How many named hurricanes formed during the 1990 season? Answer:",
