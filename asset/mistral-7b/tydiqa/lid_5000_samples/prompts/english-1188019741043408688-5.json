Passage: The player assumes the role of Neku Sakuraba(\u685c\u5ead \u97f3\u64cd,Sakuraba Neku, \u30cd\u30af Neku), an asocial teenage boy who claims he does not \"get\" people, and rarely interacts with others. Computer-controlled characters make up the rest of the cast, which includes Players who are paired with Neku.[6] In the first Game, Neku is paired with Shiki Misaki(\u7f8e\u54b2 \u56db\u5b63,Misaki Shiki, \u30b7\u30ad Shiki), a teenage girl who takes on the form of her best friend, as her physical appearance was her price of entry for the Game.[7] In the second Game, Neku's partner is an intelligent and sly teenage boy, Yoshiya Kiryu(\u6850\u751f \u7fa9\u5f25,Kiry\u016b Yoshiya), who prefers to be called Joshua(\u30e8\u30b7\u30e5\u30a2,Yoshua). Neku's final partner is Daisukenojo Bito(\u5c3e\u85e4 \u5927\u8f14\u4e4b\u4e1e,Bit\u014d Daisukenoj\u014d), an ex-Reaper who calls himself \"Beat\"(\u30d3\u30a4\u30c8,Biito).[8] Beat became a Reaper to find a way to bring his younger sister, Raimu Bito(\u5c3e\u85e4 \u6765\u5922,Bit\u014d Raimu) (nicknamed \"Rhyme\"(\u30e9\u30a4\u30e0,Raimu)), back to life. Rhyme had sacrificed herself to save her brother from a Noise attack.[9] Sanae Hanekoma(\u7fbd\u72db \u65e9\u82d7,Hanekoma Sanae, \u30cf\u30cd\u30b3\u30de Hanekoma), the Producer, bound her soul to a pin from which her Noise could be summoned, and gave it to Beat. The final Game Master, Mitsuki Konishi(\u865a\u897f \u5145\u5983,Konishi Mitsuki, \u30b3\u30cb\u30b7 Konishi), crushes her Noise form and transformed it back into a pin.
