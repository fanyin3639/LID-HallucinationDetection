    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Macleod met Evelyn Hester Mason, n\u00e9e Blois, (1915\u20131999) in September 1939 whilst he was waiting to be called up for army service and she interviewed him for a job as an ambulance driver.[84] After her first husband was killed in the war, they married on 25 January 1941. The Macleods had a son and a daughter, Torquil and Diana, who were born in 1942 and 1944 respectively.[1] They had a somewhat stormy marriage in which they retained a strong bond despite Macleod conducting a number of what his biographer describes as \"romances\" with other women (he quotes love letters written by Macleod but does not specifically say they went as far as sexual affairs). As was common for MPs' wives of the era, Eve looked after constituency matters whilst her husband concentrated on his career at Westminster.[85] Question: Who was Iain Norman Macleod wife? Answer:",
