    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation affects the location of the jet stream, which alters rainfall patterns across the West, Midwest, the Southeast, and throughout the tropics.  The shift in the jet stream also leads to shifts in the occurrence of severe weather, and the number of tropical cyclones expected within the tropics in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans affected by changes in the ocean temperature and the subtropical jet stream. The winter will have a negative phase according to the Arctic oscillation (AO).[1] Question: How does El Nino affect North American weather patterns? Answer:",
