    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is a project to create a large telescope array consisting of a global network of radio telescopes and combining data from several very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) stations around the Earth. The aim is to observe the immediate environment of the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* at the center of the Milky Way, as well as the even larger black hole in the supergiant elliptical galaxy Messier 87, with angular resolution comparable to the black hole's event horizon.[1][2][3][4][5] Question: What kind of telescope was used to get pictures of the black hole? Answer:",
