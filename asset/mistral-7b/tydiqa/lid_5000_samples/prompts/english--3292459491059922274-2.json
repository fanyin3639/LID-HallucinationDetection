Nolot travelled to 19 different countries to collect the film's content.[3] These filming locations included countries in the Middle East, Europe, North America, and Asia.[4] Nolot attested to having found producing the film difficult because of the subject matter; he stated that \"there is not a day that goes by that I am not mindful of the horrific tragedies we uncovered\".
