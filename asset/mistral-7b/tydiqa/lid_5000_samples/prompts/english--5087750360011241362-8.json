    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The term genetic engineering is applied to genetic modifications made using biotechnology. The first plant produced in that way came in 1982, an antibiotic-resistant tobacco plant.[38] The first field trials occurred in France and the USA in 1986, using tobacco plants engineered for herbicide resistance.[39] In 1987, Plant Genetic Systems (Ghent, Belgium), founded by Marc Van Montagu and Jeff Schell, was the first company to genetically engineer insect-resistant (tobacco) plants by incorporating genes that produced insecticidal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt).[40] Question: What was the first genetically modified crop plant? Answer:",
