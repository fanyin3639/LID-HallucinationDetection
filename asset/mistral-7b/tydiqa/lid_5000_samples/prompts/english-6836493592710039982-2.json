    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya was built in 1991 and began hosting the Spanish Grand Prix that same year. Construction also coincided with the Olympic Games scheduled to take place in Barcelona[4] the next year, where the circuit acted as the start and finish line for the road team time trial cycling event.[5] The Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya should not be confused with the Montju\u00efc circuit, which hosted the Spanish Grand Prix four times between 1969 and 1975 and, unlike the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, is actually located within the city of Barcelona. Question: When was the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya built? Answer:",
