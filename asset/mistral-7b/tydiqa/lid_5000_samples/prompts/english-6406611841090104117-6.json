    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: An average adult male measures 244cm (8ft 0in) in length, and stands 133cm (4ft 4in) tall at the shoulder. The largest recorded wild male weighed 751kg (1,656lb), and had a hind foot measurement of 46cm (18in).[7] A large male Kodiak bear stands up to 1.5m (4.9ft) tall at the shoulder, when it is standing on all four legs. When standing fully upright on its hind legs, a large male could reach a height of 3m (9.8ft).[2] The largest verified size for a captive Kodiak bear was for a specimen that lived at the Dakota Zoo in Bismarck, North Dakota. Nicknamed \"Clyde,\" he weighed 966kg (2,130lb) when he died in June 1987 at the age of 22. According to zoo director Terry Lincoln, Clyde probably weighed close to 1,090kg (2,400lb) a year earlier. He still had a fat layer of 9in (23cm) when he died.[8][lower-alpha 1] Question: How large is the adult male Kodiak bear? Answer:",
