    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: An aerosol is a suspension of fine solid particles or liquid droplets, in air or another gas.[1] Aerosols can be natural or anthropogenic. Examples of natural aerosols are fog, dust, forest exudates and geyser steam. Examples of anthropogenic aerosols are haze, particulate air pollutants and smoke.[1] The liquid or solid particles have diameters typically <1\u03bcm; larger particles with a significant settling speed make the mixture a suspension, but the distinction is not clear-cut. In general conversation, aerosol usually refers to an aerosol spray that delivers a consumer product from a can or similar container. Other technological applications of aerosols include dispersal of pesticides, medical treatment of respiratory illnesses, and convincing technology.[2] Diseases can also spread by means of small droplets in the breath, also called aerosols (or sometimes bioaerosols).[3] Question: What is an aerosol?
