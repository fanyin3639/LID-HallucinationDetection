Passage: Named for its pale coloration, it is closely related to the relatively common shovelnose sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus platorynchus), but is much larger, averaging between 30 and 60 inches (76 and 152cm) in length and 85 pounds (39kg) in weight at maturity.[2][3] This species takes 15years to mature and spawns infrequently, but can live up to a century. A member of the sturgeon family, Acipenseridae, which originated during the Cretaceous period 70million years ago, the pallid sturgeon has changed little since then.[4] Question: How long are pallid sturgeons?
