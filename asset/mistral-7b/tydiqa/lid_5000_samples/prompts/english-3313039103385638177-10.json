    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: To maintain the show's plausibility, creator/executive producer Kenneth Johnson set very specific limits on Jaime Sommers's abilities. He elaborated, \"When you\u2019re dealing with the area of fantasy, if you say, \u2018Well, they\u2019re bionic so they can do whatever they want,\u2019 then it gets out of hand, so you\u2019ve got to have really, really tight rules. [Steve and Jaime] can jump up two stories but not three. They can jump down three stories but not four. Jaime can\u2019t turn over a truck but she can turn over a car.\"[4] These limits were occasionally incorporated into episodes, such as \"Kill Oscar Part 1,\" in which Jaime is forced to make a jump that's too far down for her bionic legs, causing massive damage to them and nearly causing her death as a result. Question: Who created the television series The Bionic Woman? Answer:",
