    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: SR5 was established at least as early as 1919 from SR3 in Marietta to the Tennessee state line north-northwest of Blue Ridge. SR8 was established at this time on the path of SR5 from Douglasville to Austell.[2] By the end of 1926, US78 was designated on SR8 between Douglasville and Austell. The Pickens County portion of the Canton\u2013Jasper segment of SR5 had a \"completed hard surface\". Two segments had a \"completed semi hard surface\": the Cherokee County portion of the Canton\u2013Jasper segment and the southern half of the segment from Blue Ridge to the Tennessee state line. Two segments had a \"sand clay or top soil\": the Douglasville\u2013Austell segment of US78/SR8 and the Cherokee County portion of the Marietta\u2013Canton segment of SR5. Two segments were under construction: the Jasper\u2013Ellijay segment and the northern half of the Blue Ridge\u2013Tennessee segment.[4][5] By the end of 1929, two segments had a completed hard surface: a small portion just north of the Cobb\u2013Cherokee county line and from a point northeast of Canton to just north of the Pickens\u2013Gilmer county line. Two segments had a completed semi hard surface: nearly the entire Gilmer County portion of the Jasper\u2013Ellijay segment (except for the extreme southern part) and the northern half of the Blue Ridge\u2013Tennessee segment. The Ellijay\u2013Blue Ridge segment was under construction.[5][6] Question: When did construction on Georgia State Route 5 begin? Answer:",
