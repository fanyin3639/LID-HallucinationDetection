    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Machu Picchu was built around 1450\u20131460.[21] Its construction appears to date to the period of the two great Inca rulers, Pachacutec Inca Yupanqui (1438\u20131471) and T\u00fapac Inca Yupanqui (1472\u20131493).[22][23]:xxxvi There is a consensus among archaeologists that Pachacutec ordered the construction of the royal estate for himself, most likely after his successful military campaign. Though Machu Picchu is considered to be a \"royal\" estate, surprisingly, the estate would not have been passed down in the line of succession. It was only used for approximately 80 years before being abandoned seemingly due to destruction of the Spanish Conquests in other parts of the Inca Empire.[21] It is possible that most of its inhabitants died from smallpox introduced by travellers before the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the area.[24] Question: Who built the city of Machu Picchu?
