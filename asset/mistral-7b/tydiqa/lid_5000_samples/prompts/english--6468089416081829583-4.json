    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The total energy of a system can be subdivided and classified into potential energy, kinetic energy, or combinations of the two in various ways. Kinetic energy is determined by the movement of an object \u2013 or the composite motion of the components of an object \u2013 and potential energy reflects the potential of an object to have motion, and generally is a function of the position of an object within a field or may stored in the field itself. Question: What are the main forms of energy? Answer:",
