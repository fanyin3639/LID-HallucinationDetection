    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage:  Neuroplasticity, also known as brain plasticity, neuroelasticity, or  neural plasticity, is the ability of the brain to change throughout an individual's life, e.g., brain activity associated with a given function can be transferred to a different location, the proportion of grey matter can change, and synapses may strengthen or weaken over time. Research in the latter half of the 20th century showed that many aspects of the brain can be altered (or are \"plastic\") even through adulthood.[1][2][3][4] However, the developing brain exhibits a higher degree of plasticity than the adult brain.[5][6]:30 Question: What is neuroplasticity?
