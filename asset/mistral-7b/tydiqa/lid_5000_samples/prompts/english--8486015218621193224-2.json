    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The series is centered around the exploits of  Billy (voiced by Richard Steven Horvitz), a completely idiotic and happy-go-lucky boy; Mandy (Grey DeLisle), a cynical and merciless girl, and Grim (Greg Eagles), the Grim Reaper who is often tormented by the duo. After cheating at a limbo match against Grim (in retaliation for putting the limbo rod too low for them to go under), he is enslaved in a permanently  unwanted friendship with the children.[2] Grim is miserable in the first days of his servitude, and even fantasizes about killing them multiple times. However, as the time passes, he gradually adapts to the new life, and even grows to care for Billy and Mandy, if only somewhat. Despite this, he retains a love-hate relationship with the two and desires to eventually break free from his servitude. Question: Who voiced Grim? Answer:",
