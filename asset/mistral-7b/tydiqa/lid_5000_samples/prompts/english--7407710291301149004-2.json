    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Dualism is closely associated with the thought of Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1641), which holds that the mind is a nonphysical\u2014and therefore, non-spatial\u2014substance. Descartes clearly identified the mind with consciousness and self-awareness and distinguished this from the brain as the seat of intelligence.[6] Hence, he was the first to formulate the mind\u2013body problem in the form in which it exists today.[7] Dualism is contrasted with various kinds of monism. Substance dualism is contrasted with all forms of materialism, but property dualism may be considered a form of emergent materialism or non-reductive physicalism in some sense. Question: Who proposed dualism? Answer:",
