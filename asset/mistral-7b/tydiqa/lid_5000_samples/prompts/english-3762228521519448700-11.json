    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: While not yet a town at the time of Julius Caesar, the region was occupied by the Nerviens.   Near the Fauroeulx gate of the town in 1933, Roman pottery was discovered. Under the Merovingian and Carolingian, we find no evidence of a major population centre in the vicinity. However, the historian Jacques de Guise, claims that at that time the town was founded by a brave knight named Aymond, who lived around the year 800:This Aymond was Count of Faumars (Famars) and Ardennes, also by his loyalty to the king, he and all four sons tended the deep wood, where they made a fortress and a place called Carcetus,Le Quesnoy. The legendary story of the epic by Renaud of Montauban the horse Bayard and the four Aymond sons\u201d is still known today from the Ardennes forest to the forest of Orleans).   Despite this assertion, the historian Valenciennes d\u2019Oultreman said he could be a character named Aymon: governor of Ponthieu?  Furthermore, the historian Jules Duvivier would rather name an ancient Count of Hainaut: indeed, in the 8th century, portions of territories around the present town belonged to the Leudes, fellows of the Frankish kings to whom they were granted. In the 9th century, the region was occupied by the Vikings who settled there along rivers.  Around the year 842 at the time of King Charles the Bald, they were blocked at Valenciennes, as the river became too narrow for their boats. Later, the land at Le Queroy became a freehold belonging to the Episcopal mass at Cambrai and by the name of</i>Noflus, latinized from Novem fluctibus.[6] Finally, 1148, the freehold was sold by the Bishop of Cambrai, Nicolas de Chi\u00e8vres to Count Baldwin IV of Hainaut.[7] Question: When was Le Quesnoy founded?
