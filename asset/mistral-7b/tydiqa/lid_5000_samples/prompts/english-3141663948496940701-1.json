    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The ILGWU was founded on June 3, 1900[2] in New York City by seven local unions, with a few thousand members between them. The union grew rapidly in the next few years but began to stagnate as the conservative leadership favored the interests of skilled workers, such as cutters. This did not sit well with the majority of immigrant workers, particularly Jewish workers with a background in Bundist activities in Tsarist Russia, or with Polish and Italian workers, many of whom had strong socialist and anarchist leanings. Question: When was the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union formed? Answer:",
