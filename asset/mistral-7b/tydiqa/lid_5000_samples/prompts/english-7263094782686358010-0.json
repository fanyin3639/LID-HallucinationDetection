    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The visible spectrum is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to the human eye. Electromagnetic radiation in this range of wavelengths is called visible light or simply light. A typical human eye will respond to wavelengths from about 380 to 740 nanometers.[1] In terms of frequency, this corresponds to a band in the vicinity of 430\u2013770 THz. Question: What is the wavelength of visible light? Answer:",
