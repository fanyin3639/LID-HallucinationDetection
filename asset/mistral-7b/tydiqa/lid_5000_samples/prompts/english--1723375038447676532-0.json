    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The history of the British Raj refers to the period of British rule on the Indian subcontinent between 1858 and 1947.  The system of governance was instituted in 1858 when the rule of the East India Company was transferred to the Crown in the person of Queen Victoria (who in 1876 was proclaimed Empress of India).  It lasted until 1947, when the British provinces of India were partitioned into two sovereign dominion states: the Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan, leaving the princely states to choose between them. The two new dominions later became the Republic of India and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (the eastern half of which, still later, became the People's Republic of Bangladesh).  The province of Burma in the eastern region of the Indian Empire had been made a separate colony in 1937 and became independent in 1948. Question: When did India gain independence from the British Empire? Answer:",
