    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Fran\u00e7ois Lay, better known under the stage name Lays [1] (14 February 1758 \u2013 30 March 1831[2]), was a French baritone and tenor opera singer. Originally destined for a career in the church, Lays was recruited by the Paris Op\u00e9ra in 1779. He soon became a leading member of the company, in spite of quarrels with the management. Lays enthusiastically welcomed the French Revolution and became involved in politics with the encouragement of his friend Bertrand Bar\u00e8re. Bar\u00e8re's downfall led to Lays being imprisoned briefly, but he soon won back the public and secured the patronage of Napoleon, at whose coronation and second wedding he sang. This association with the Emperor caused him trouble when the Bourbon monarchy was restored and Lays's final years were darkened by disputes over his pension, mounting debts, the death of his only son and his wife's illness. After a career spanning more than four decades, he died in poverty. Question: When was Fran\u00e7ois Lay born? Answer:",
