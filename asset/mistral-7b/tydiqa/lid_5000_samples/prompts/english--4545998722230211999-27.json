    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Europe knew of Madagascar through Arab sources; based on them The Travels of Marco Polo claimed that \"the inhabitants are Saracens, or followers of the law of Mohammed\", without mentioning other inhabitants. Other than its size and location, everything about the island in the book describes southeastern Africa, not Madagascar. European contact began on 10 August 1500, when the Portuguese sea captain Diogo Dias sighted the island after his ship separated from a fleet going to India.[49][4] The Portuguese continued trading with the islanders and named the island S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o (Saint Lawrence). In 1666, Fran\u00e7ois Caron, the director general of the newly formed French East India Company, sailed to Madagascar.[50] The company failed to establish a colony on Madagascar but established ports on the nearby islands of Bourbon (now R\u00e9union) and Isle de France (now Mauritius). In the late 17th century, the French established trading posts along the east coast. On \u00cele Sainte-Marie, a small island off the northeastern coast of Madagascar, Captain Misson and his pirate crew allegedly founded the famous pirate utopia of Libertatia in the late 17th century. From about 1774 to 1824, Madagascar was a favorite haunt for pirates.  Many European sailors were shipwrecked on the coasts of the island, among them Robert Drury, whose journal is one of the few written depictions of life in southern Madagascar during the 18th century.[51] Sailors sometimes called Madagascar \"Island of the Moon\".[52] Question: Who was the first European to discover Madagascar?
