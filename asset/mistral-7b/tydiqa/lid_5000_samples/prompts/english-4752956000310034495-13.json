    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Several days after the Victoria Aristocrats \u2013 Toronto Hockey Club series, Stanley Cup trustee William Foran wrote to NHA president Emmett Quinn that the trustees are \"perfectly satisfied to allow the representatives of the three pro leagues (NHA, PCHA, and Maritime) to make all arrangements each season as to the series of matches to be played for the Cup.\" Maritime league did not challenge for cup in 1914, and folded after 1915 season.[20] The Stanley Cup championship finals alternated between the East and the West each year, with games played alternately under NHA or PCHA rules.[21] The Cup trustees agreed to this new arrangement, because after the Allan Cup became the highest prize for amateur hockey teams in Canada, the trustees had become dependent on the top two professional leagues to bolster the prominence of the trophy.[22] After the New Westminster Royal moved to Portland in the summer of 1914 becoming the Portland Rosebuds, an American-based team, the trustees issued a statement that the Cup was no longer for the best team in Canada, but now for the best team in the world.[21]  In March 1916, the Rosebuds became the first American team to play in the Stanley Cup championship final.[23] In 1917, the Seattle Metropolitans became the first American team to win the Cup.[24] After that season, the NHA was suspended and the National Hockey League (NHL) took its place.[21] Question: Who was the first Stanley Cup winner?
