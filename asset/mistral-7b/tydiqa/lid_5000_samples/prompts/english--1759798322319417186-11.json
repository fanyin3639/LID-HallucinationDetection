    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: In 1947, Raytheon built the \"Radarange\", the first commercially available microwave oven.[13] It was almost 1.8 metres (5ft 11in) tall, weighed 340 kilograms (750lb) and cost about US$5,000 ($56,000 in 2018 dollars) each. It consumed 3 kilowatts, about three times as much as today's microwave ovens, and was water-cooled. The name was the winning entry in an employee contest.[14] An early Radarange was installed (and remains) in the galley of the nuclear-powered passenger/cargo ship NS Savannah. An early commercial model introduced in 1954 consumed 1.6 kilowatts and sold for US$2,000 to US$3,000 ($19,000 to $28,000 in 2018 dollars). Raytheon licensed its technology to the Tappan Stove company of Mansfield, Ohio in 1952.[15] They tried to market a large 220 volt wall unit as a home microwave oven in 1955 for a price of US$1,295 ($12,000 in 2018 dollars), but it did not sell well. Question: How much did the first microwave oven cost? Answer:",
