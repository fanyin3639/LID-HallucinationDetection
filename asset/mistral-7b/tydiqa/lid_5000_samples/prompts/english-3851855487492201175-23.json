Its coordinates are latitude 45 \u00b0 27 'north and longitude 28 \u00b0 02' east. Its area is 246.4 square kilometers (95.1sqmi). Gala\u021bi lies in the southern part of the Moldavian Plateau on the left (west) bank of the Danube river at the junction of the Siret River (west) and the Prut River (east), near Lake Brates. It is 80 kilometers (50mi) from the Black Sea. The nearest town is Br\u0103ila, 15 kilometers (9.3mi) to the south. Gala\u021bi is built on three geological terraces. One lies beneath \"Valley City\", with elevations between 5 and 7 metres (16 and 23ft). The other two, which make a fan shape, have elevations of 20\u201325 meters (66\u201382ft) (the site of the old town, now the city centre) and 40 meters (130ft) (the site of the modern city) respectively. The Danube river is considered the \"life-blood\" of Gala\u021bi. The Danube is the second longest river in Europe 2,850km [1,770mi]), with an average flow of 6,199 cubic meters (218,900cuft) per second in the Gala\u021bi section. After the Siret River, the largest tributary in Romania, joins the Danube, the flow is 210 cubic meters per second (7,400cuft/s). After the Prut River joins the Danube, the flow becomes 86 cubic meters per second (3,000cuft/s). The Danube river flows have significant seasonal variation. The maximum flows occur in May; 18,000\u201319,000m3/s or 640,000\u2013670,000cuft/s. The minimum flows occur during the summer; 2,000\u20132,450m3/s or 71,000\u201387,000cuft/s.
