    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: In 1889, she sent out three poems for publication. They were sent to Scribner\u2019s, Harper\u2019s and Century. Edward L. Burlingame published \"The Last Giustiniani\" for Scribner\u2019s. It was not until Wharton was 29 that her first short story was published. \"Mrs. Manstey's View\" had very little success, and it took her more than a year to publish another story. She completed \"The Fullness of Life\" following her annual European trip with Teddy. Burlingame was critical of this story but Wharton did not want to make edits to it. This story, along with many others, speaks about her marriage. She sent Bunner Sisters to Scribner's in 1892. Burlingame wrote back that it was too long for Scribner's to publish. This story is believed to be based on an experience she had as a child. It did not see publication until 1916 and is included in the collection called Xingu. After a visit with her friend, Paul Bourget, she wrote \"The Good May Come\" and \"The Lamp of Psyche\". \"The Lamp of Psyche\" was a comical story with verbal wit and sorrow. After \"Something Exquisite\" was rejected by Burlingame, she lost confidence in herself. She started \"travel writing\" in 1894.[37] Question: What was Edith Wharton's last book? Answer:",
