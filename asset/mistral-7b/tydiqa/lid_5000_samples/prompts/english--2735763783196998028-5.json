    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The general appearance of the Anatolian Shepherd Dog is a tall, rugged and powerful livestock guardian dog with a dense double coat, a broad strong head, well-developed muscular shoulders, and a long tail with a slight curl (reaching to the hock), that is carried high and curled over the dog's back when the dog is alert.   The physique embodies balance and strength.  Movement of the Anatolian Shepherd Dog should be supple and powerful.  A low head carriage which shows the head, neck and topline being level when moving - creating the impression that the dog is stalking - is an important characteristic of the breed[14]. As with many breeds, there are several breed standards for the Anatolian Shepherd Dog, and therefore there is some variance in the described size and weight. They weigh between 40 and 70kg (90 and 150 pounds), with females on the smaller side and males on the larger side. The coat may be any colour, although most common are white cream, \"sesame,\" and white with large coloured spots that do not cover more than 30% of the body. Known as piebald, these colours may or may not be accompanied by a black mask and/or ears. They have a thick double coat that is somewhat wiry, and needs to be brushed 1-2 times a week in warm weather due to excessive shedding. They have very thick hair on their neck to protect their throat. They look as if they are heavier than they actually are, due to the thick coat. Question: How large is an Anatolian Shepard? Answer:",
