Passage: The word schizophrenia\u2014which translates roughly as \"splitting of the mind\" and comes from the Greek roots schizein (\u03c3\u03c7\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, \"to split\") and phr\u0113n, phren- (\u03c6\u03c1\u03ae\u03bd, \u03c6\u03c1\u03b5\u03bd-, \"mind\")[23]\u2014was coined by Eugen Bleuler in 1908 and was intended to describe the separation of function between personality, thinking, memory, and perception. Bleuler described the main symptoms as four A's: flattened Affect, Autism, impaired Association of ideas and Ambivalence.[24] Bleuler realized that the illness was not a dementia as some of his patients improved rather than deteriorated and hence proposed the term schizophrenia instead. However, many at the time did not accept that splitting or dissociation was an appropriate description, and the term would later have more significance as a source of confusion and social stigma than scientific meaning.[25] Question: Where did the word schizophrenia come from?
