    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Research on the relationship between culture and emotions dates back to 1872 when Darwin[2]  argued that emotions and the expression of emotions are universal. Since that time, the universality of the six basic emotions[3]  (i.e., happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise) has ignited a discussion amongst psychologists, anthropologists, and sociologists.  While emotions themselves are universal phenomena, they are always influenced by culture.  How emotions are experienced, expressed, perceived, and regulated varies as a function of culturally normative behavior by the surrounding society.  Therefore, it can be said that culture is a necessary framework for researchers to understand variations in emotions.[4] Question: What are the universal emotions? Answer:",
