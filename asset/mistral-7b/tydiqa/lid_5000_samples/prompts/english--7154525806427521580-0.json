    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The Asian giant hornet (Vespa mandarinia), including the subspecies Japanese giant hornet (V. m. japonica),[2] colloquially known as the yak-killer hornet,[3] is the world's largest hornet, native to temperate and tropical Eastern Asia. They prefer to live in low mountains and forests, while almost completely avoiding plains and high-altitude climates. V. mandarinia creates nests by digging, co-opting pre-existing tunnels dug by rodents, or occupying spaces near rotted pine roots.[4] It feeds primarily on larger insects, colonies of other eusocial insects, tree sap, and honey from honey bee colonies.[5] The hornet has a body length of 45mm (1.8in), a wingspan around 75mm (3.0in), and a stinger 6mm (0.24in) long, which injects a large amount of potent venom.[6] Question: What's the biggest wasp?
