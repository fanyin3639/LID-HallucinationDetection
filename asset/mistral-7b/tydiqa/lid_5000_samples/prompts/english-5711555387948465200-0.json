    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Magnetoreception (also magnetoception) is a sense which allows an organism to detect a magnetic field to perceive direction, altitude or location. This sensory modality is used by a range of animals for orientation and navigation,[1] and as a method for animals to develop regional maps. For the purpose of navigation, magnetoreception deals with the detection of the Earth's magnetic field. Question: Do birds use magnetoreception? Answer:",
