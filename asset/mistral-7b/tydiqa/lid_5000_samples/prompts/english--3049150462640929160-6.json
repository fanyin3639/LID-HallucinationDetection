    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The term \"function\" was literally introduced by Gottfried Leibniz, in a 1673 letter, to describe a quantity related to points of a curve, such as a coordinate or curve's slope.[9] Johann Bernoulli started calling expressions made of a single variable \"functions.\" In 1698, he agreed with Leibniz that any quantity formed \"in an algebraic and transcendental manner\" may be called a function of x.[10] By 1718, he came to regard as a function \"any expression made up of a variable and some constants.\"[11] Alexis Claude Clairaut (in approximately 1734) and Leonhard Euler introduced the familiar notation      f ( x )    {\\displaystyle {f(x)}}   for the value of a function.[12] Question: Who first introduced the concept of mathematical functions? Answer:",
