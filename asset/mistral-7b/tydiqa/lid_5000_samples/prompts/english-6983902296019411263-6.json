    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: One of Wilson's earliest musical projects was the psychedelic duo Altamont (featuring a 15-year-old Wilson working with synth/electronics player Simon Vockings). Their one and only cassette album, Prayer for the Soul, featured lyrics by English psychedelic scenester Alan Duffy, whose work Wilson would later use for two Porcupine Tree songs: \"This Long Silence\" and \"It Will Rain for a Million Years\". Around the same time that Wilson was part of Altamont, he was also in a progressive rock band called Karma, which played live around Hertfordshire and recorded two cassette albums, The Joke's On You (1983) and The Last Man To Laugh (1985). These contained early versions of \"Small Fish\", \"Nine Cats\" and \"The Joke's On You\", which were subsequently resurrected as Porcupine Tree songs. Question: What was Wilson's first band? Answer:",
