    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Manon Lescaut premiered at the Teatro Regio in Turin on 2 February 1893.[10] By coincidence, Puccini's first enduringly popular opera appeared within a week of the premiere of Verdi's last opera, Falstaff, which was first performed on 9 February 1893.[10] In anticipation of the premiere, La Stampa wrote that Puccini was a young man concerning whom \"great hopes\" had a real basis (\"un giovane che e tra i pochi sul quale le larghe speranze non siano benigne illusioni\").[10] Because of the failure of Edgar, however, a failure of Manon Lescaut could have jeopardized Puccini's future as a composer. Although Giulio Ricordi, head of Casa Ricordi, was supportive of Puccini while Manon Lescaut was still in development, the Casa Ricordi board of directors was considering cutting off Puccini's financial support.[11] In any event, \"Manon Lescaut was Puccini's first and only uncontested triumph, acclaimed by critics and public alike.\"[12] After the London premiere in 1894, George Bernard Shaw pronounced: \"Puccini looks to me more like the heir of Verdi than any of his rivals.\"[13] Question: What was Puccini's first opera? Answer:",
