The county was an early centre of English textile manufacturing, benefiting from the presence of deposits of fuller's earth, the rare mineral composite important in the process of finishing cloth, around Reigate and Nutfield.[37] The industry in Surrey was focused on Guildford, which gave its name to a variety of cloth, gilforte, which was exported widely across Europe and the Middle East and imitated by manufacturers elsewhere in Europe.[38] However, as the English cloth industry expanded, Surrey was outstripped by other growing regions of production. Question: What is the number one industry in the county of Surrey in England? Answer:",
