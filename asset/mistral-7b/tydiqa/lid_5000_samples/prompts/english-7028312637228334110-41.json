    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The lever escapement, invented by Thomas Mudge in 1750, has been used in the vast majority of watches since the 19th century.  Its advantages are (1) it is a \"detached\" escapement; unlike the cylinder or duplex escapements the balance wheel is only in contact with the lever during the short impulse period when it swings through its centre position and swings freely the rest of its cycle, increasing accuracy, and (2) it is a self-starting escapement, so if the watch is shaken so that the balance wheel stops, it will automatically start again.  The original form was the rack lever escapement, in which the lever and the balance wheel were always in contact via a gear rack on the lever. Later, it was realized that all the teeth from the gears could be removed except one, and this created the detached lever escapement.  British watchmakers used the English detached lever, in which the lever was at right angles to the balance wheel.  Later Swiss and American manufacturers used the inline lever, in which the lever is inline between the balance wheel and the escape wheel; this is the form used in modern watches.  In 1867 Georges Frederic Roskopf invented an inexpensive, less accurate form called the Roskopf or pin-pallet escapement, which was used in cheap \"dollar watches\" in the early 20th century and is still used in cheap alarm clocks and kitchen timers.
