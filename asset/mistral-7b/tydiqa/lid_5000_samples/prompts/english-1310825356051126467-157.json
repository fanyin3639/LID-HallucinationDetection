    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: According to the recent biography of Zhou by an anti-communist political pundit Gao Wenqian, Zhou was first diagnosed with bladder cancer in November 1972.[195] Gao Wenqian claimed that Zhou's medical team reported that with treatment he had an 80 to 90 percent chance of recovery, but medical treatment for the highest ranking party members had to be approved by Mao. Gao Wenqian also claimed in his book that Mao ordered that Zhou and his wife should not be told of the diagnosis, no surgery should be performed, and no further examinations should be given.[196] By 1974, Zhou was experiencing significant bleeding in his urine.  After pressure by other Chinese leaders who had learned of Zhou's condition, Mao finally ordered a surgical operation to be performed in June 1974, but the bleeding returned a few months later, indicating metastasis of the cancer into other organs.  A series of operations over the next year and a half failed to check the progress of the cancer.[197] Zhou continued to conduct work during his stays in the hospital, with Deng Xiaoping, as the First Deputy Premier, handling most of the important State Council matters. His last major public appearance was at the first meeting of the 4th National People's Congress on 13 January 1975, where he presented the government's work report. He then fell out of the public eye for more medical treatment.[198] Zhou Enlai died from cancer at 09:57 on 8 January 1976, aged 77. Question: How did Zhou Enlai die? Answer:",
