    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: A peninsula (Latin: paeninsula from paene \"almost\u201d and insula \"island\") is a landform surrounded by water on the majority of its border while being connected to a mainland from which it extends.[1][2][3][4] The surrounding water is usually understood to be continuous, though not necessarily named as a single body of water. Peninsulas are not always named as such; one can also be a headland, cape, island promontory, bill, point, or spit.[5] A point is generally considered a tapering piece of land projecting into a body of water that is less prominent than a cape.[6] A river which courses through a very tight meander is also sometimes said to form a \"peninsula\" within the (almost closed) loop of water. In English, the plural versions of peninsula are peninsulas and, less commonly, peninsulae. Question: What's a peninsula? Answer:",
