    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Galileo went on to propose a theory of tides in 1616, and of comets in 1619; he argued that the tides were evidence for the motion of the earth. In 1632 Galileo, now an old man, published his Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, which implicitly defended heliocentrism, and was immensely popular. Responding to mounting controversy over theology, astronomy and philosophy, the Roman Inquisition tried Galileo in 1633 and found him \"vehemently suspect of heresy\", sentencing him to indefinite imprisonment. Galileo was kept under house arrest until his death in 1642. Question: When was Galileo found guilty of heresy? Answer:",
