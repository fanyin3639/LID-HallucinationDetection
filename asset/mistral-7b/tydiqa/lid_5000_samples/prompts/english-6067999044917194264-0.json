    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane, also known as the 1899 Puerto Rico Hurricane or The Great Bahamas Hurricane of 1899, was the longest-lived Atlantic hurricane on record, and the second-longest-lived tropical cyclone globally on record (in terms of tropical duration) after Hurricane John in the Pacific. The third tropical cyclone and first major hurricane of the season, this storm was first observed southwest of Cape Verde on August3. It slowly strengthened while heading steadily west-northwestward across the Atlantic Ocean and reached hurricane status by late on August5. During the following 48hours, it deepened further, reaching Category4 on the modern day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS) before crossing the Leeward Islands on August7. Later that day, the storm peaked winds of 150mph (240km/h). The storm weakened slightly before making landfall in Guayama, Puerto Rico with winds of 140mph (220km/h) on August8. Several hours later, it emerged into the southwestern Atlantic as a Category3 hurricane. The system paralleled the north coast of Dominican Republic and then crossed the Bahamas, striking several islands. Thereafter, it began heading northward on August14, while centered east of Florida. Early on the following day, the storm re-curved northeastward and appeared to be heading out to sea. However, by August17, it turned back to the northwest and made landfall near Hatteras, North Carolina early on the following day. No stronger hurricane has made landfall on the Outer Banks since the San Ciriaco hurricane. Question: Where did the San Ciriaco hurricane make landfall? Answer:",
