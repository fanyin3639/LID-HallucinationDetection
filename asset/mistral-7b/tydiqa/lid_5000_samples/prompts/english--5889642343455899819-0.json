Passage: The Battle of Kham Duc was a major battle of the Vietnam War (in Vietnam the \"American War\"). The event occurred in Kh\u00e2m \u0110\u1ee9c, now district capital of Ph\u01b0\u1edbc S\u01a1n District, then in Qu\u1ea3ng T\u00edn Province (now part of Qu\u1ea3ng Nam Province, South Vietnam), from 10\u201312 May 1968. During the Tet Offensive of 1968, the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 2nd Division tried to capture \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng, but they were defeated in the Battle of Lo Giang by elements of the U.S. 1st Marine Division, the 23rd Infantry Division (Americal). PAVN General Chu Huy M\u00e2n decided to disengage from the fight in the outskirts of the city, and pull the 2nd Division into the mountains where they could rest, rebuild, and prepare for the next major operation. Kh\u00e2m \u0110\u1ee9c, a small district in the north of Qu\u1ea3ng T\u00edn, was chosen as the next target for the 2nd Division. Following their defeat at \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng, U.S. military intelligence agencies in I Corps Tactical Zone were confused by the movements of the 2nd Division, because they could not track down the unit.
