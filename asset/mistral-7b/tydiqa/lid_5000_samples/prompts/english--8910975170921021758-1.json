    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Lanthanum usually occurs together with cerium and the other rare earth elements. Lanthanum was first found by the Swedish chemist Carl Gustav Mosander in 1839 as an impurity in cerium nitrate \u2013 hence the name lanthanum, from the Ancient Greek \u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (lanthanein), meaning \"to lie hidden\". Although it is classified as a rare earth element, lanthanum is the 28th most abundant element in the Earth's crust, almost three times as abundant as lead. In minerals such as monazite and bastn\u00e4site, lanthanum composes about a quarter of the lanthanide content.[5] It is extracted from those minerals by a process of such complexity that pure lanthanum metal was not isolated until 1923. Question: What is lanthanum named for? Answer:",
