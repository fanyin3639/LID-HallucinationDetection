    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Dan Patch (April 29, 1896 \u2013 July 11, 1916) was a noted American Standardbred pacer. At a time when harness racing was one of the largest sports in the nation, Dan Patch was a major celebrity. He was undefeated in open competition and was so dominant on the racetrack that other owners eventually refused to enter their horses against him. Instead, he ended his racing career performing time trials and traveled extensively on exhibition, earning millions of dollars in purses, attendance gate receipts and product endorsements. Dan Patch broke world speed records at least 14 times in the early 1900s. In 1905, he set a world's record for the fastest mile by a harness horse (1:55\u200b1\u20444 \u2013 1 minute, \u200b551\u20444 seconds) that stood unmatched for over 30 years. Unofficially, Dan Patch broke this record in 1906 with a clocking of 1:55. He died on July 11, 1916. His owner Marion Willis Savage died just one day later.[1] Question: How long did the American Standardbred Dan Patch live? Answer:",
