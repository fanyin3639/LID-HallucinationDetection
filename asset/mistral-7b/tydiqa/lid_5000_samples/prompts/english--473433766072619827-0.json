    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Algae (/\u02c8\u00e6ld\u0292i, \u02c8\u00e6l\u0261i/; singular alga /\u02c8\u00e6l\u0261\u0259/) is an informal term for a large, diverse group of photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms that are not necessarily closely related, and is thus polyphyletic. Including organisms ranging from unicellular microalgae genera, such as Chlorella and the diatoms, to multicellular forms, such as  the giant kelp, a large brown alga which may grow up to 50m in length. Most are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as stomata, xylem, and phloem, which are found in land plants. The largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds, while the most complex freshwater forms are the Charophyta, a division of green algae which includes, for example, Spirogyra and the stoneworts. Question: What is algae? Answer:",
