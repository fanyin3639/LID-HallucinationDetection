    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Gregor Johann Mendel (Czech: \u0158eho\u0159 Jan Mendel;[1] 20 July 1822[2] \u2013 6 January 1884) (English: /\u02c8m\u025bnd\u0259l/) was a scientist, Augustinian friar and abbot of St. Thomas' Abbey in Brno, Margraviate of Moravia. Mendel was born in a German-speaking family[3] in the Silesian part of the Austrian Empire (today's Czech Republic) and gained posthumous recognition as the founder of the modern science of genetics. Though farmers had known for millennia that crossbreeding of animals and plants could favor certain desirable traits, Mendel's pea plant experiments conducted between 1856 and 1863 established many of the rules of heredity, now referred to as the laws of Mendelian inheritance.[4] Question: Who was the first geneticist?
