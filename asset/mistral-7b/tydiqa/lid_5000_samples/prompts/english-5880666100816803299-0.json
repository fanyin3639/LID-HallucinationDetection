Its unit is the unified atomic mass units (abbr. u) where 1 unified atomic mass unit is defined as \u200b1\u204412 of the mass of a single carbon-12 atom, at rest.[1] For atoms, the protons and neutrons of the nucleus account for nearly all of the total mass, and the atomic mass measured in u has nearly the same value as the mass number. Question: What is atomic mass? Answer:",
