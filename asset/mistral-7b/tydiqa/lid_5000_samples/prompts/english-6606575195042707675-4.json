    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Syracuse was founded in 734 or 733BC by Greek settlers from Corinth and Tenea, led by the oecist (colonizer) Archias. There are many attested variants of the name of the city including \u03a3\u03c5\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 Syrakousai, \u03a3\u03c5\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 Syrakosai and \u03a3\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03ce Syrak\u014d.[5] A possible origin of the city's name was given by Vibius Sequester citing[11] first Stephanus Byzantius[5][12] in that there was a Syracusian marsh (\u03bb\u03af\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7) called Syrako and secondly Marcian's Periegesis wherein Archias gave the city the name of a nearby marsh; hence one gets Syrako (and thereby Syrakousai and other variants) for the name of Syracuse, a name also attested by Epicharmus.[5][13] The settlement of Syracuse was a planned event, as a strong central leader, Arkhias the aristocrat, laid out how property would be divided up for the settlers, as well as plans for how the streets of the settlement should be arranged, and how wide they should be.[14] The nucleus of the ancient city was the small island of Ortygia. The settlers found the land fertile and the native tribes to be reasonably well-disposed to their presence. The city grew and prospered, and for some time stood as the most powerful Greek city anywhere in the Mediterranean. Colonies were founded at Akrai (664BC), Kasmenai (643BC), Akrillai (7th centuryBC), Helorus (7th centuryBC) and Kamarina (598BC). Question: When was Syracuse founded by the Greeks? Answer:",
