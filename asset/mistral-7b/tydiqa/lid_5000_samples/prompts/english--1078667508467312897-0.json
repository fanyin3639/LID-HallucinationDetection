    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Pteranodon (/t\u026a\u02c8r\u00e6n\u0259d\u0252n/; from Greek \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd ( pteron, \"wing\") and \u1f00\u03bd\u03cc\u03b4\u03c9\u03bd (anodon, \"toothless\") is a genus of pterosaur that included some of the largest known flying reptiles, with wingspans over 8 meters (26 feet). They lived during the late Cretaceous geological period of North America in present-day Kansas, Alabama, Nebraska, Wyoming, and South Dakota. More fossil specimens of Pteranodon have been found than any other pterosaur, with about 1,200 specimens known to science, many of them well preserved with nearly complete skulls and articulated skeletons. It was an important part of the animal community in the Western Interior Seaway.[1] Question: How large was the Pteranodon? Answer:",
