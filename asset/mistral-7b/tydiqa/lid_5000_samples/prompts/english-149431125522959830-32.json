    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Mercury (0.4AU from the Sun) is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest planet in the Solar System (0.055M\u2295). Mercury has no natural satellites; besides impact craters, its only known geological features are lobed ridges or rupes that were probably produced by a period of contraction early in its history.[74] Mercury's very tenuous atmosphere consists of atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind.[75] Its relatively large iron core and thin mantle have not yet been adequately explained. Hypotheses include that its outer layers were stripped off by a giant impact; or, that it was prevented from fully accreting by the young Sun's energy.[76][77] Question: Which is the smallest planet? Answer:",
