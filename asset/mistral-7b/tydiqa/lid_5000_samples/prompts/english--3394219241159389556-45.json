    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The solution in radicals (without trigonometric functions) of a general cubic equation contains the square roots of negative numbers when all three roots are real numbers, a situation that cannot be rectified by factoring aided by the rational root test if the cubic is irreducible (the so-called casus irreducibilis). This conundrum led Italian mathematician Gerolamo Cardano to conceive of complex numbers in around 1545,[16] though his understanding was rudimentary. Question: Who introduced the concept of complex numbers? Answer:",
