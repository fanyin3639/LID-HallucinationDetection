    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The National Flower of the Republic of China was officially designated as the plum blossom by the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China on July 21, 1964.[1] The plum blossom, known as the meihua (Chinese:\u6885\u82b1; pinyin:m\u00e9ihu\u0101), is symbol for resilience and perseverance in the face of adversity, because plum blossoms often bloom most vibrantly even amidst the harsh winter snow.[2][3] As the plum tree can usually grow for a long time, ancient trees are found throughout China. Huangmei county (Yellow Mei) in Hubei features a 1,600-year-old plum tree from the Jin Dynasty which is still flowering. The three stamens represents Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, while the five petals symbolize the five branches of the government: Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Judicial Yuan, Examination Yuan and Control Yuan.[1][3] The flower has also been proposed to be one of the national flowers for the People's Republic of China.[4] Question: What's the national flower of Taiwan?
