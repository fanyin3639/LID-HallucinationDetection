    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Angkor Wat (/\u02cc\u00e6\u014bk\u0254\u02d0r \u02c8w\u0252t/; Khmer: \u17a2\u1784\u17d2\u1782\u179a\u179c\u178f\u17d2\u178f, \"Capital Temple\") is a temple complex in Cambodia and one of the largest religious monuments in the world, on a site measuring 162.6 hectares (1,626,000m2; 402 acres).[1] Originally constructed as a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Vishnu for the Khmer Empire, it was gradually transformed into a Buddhist temple towards the end of the 12th century.[2] It was built by the Khmer King Suryavarman II[3] in the early 12th century in Ya\u015bodharapura (Khmer: \u1799\u179f\u17c4\u1792\u179a\u1794\u17bb\u179a\u17c8, present-day Angkor), the capital of the Khmer Empire, as his state temple and eventual mausoleum. Breaking from the Shaiva tradition of previous kings, Angkor Wat was instead dedicated to Vishnu. As the best-preserved temple at the site, it is the only one to have remained a significant religious centre since its foundation. The temple is at the top of the high classical style of Khmer architecture. It has become a symbol of Cambodia,[4] appearing on its national flag, and it is the country's prime attraction for visitors.[5] Question: What does the name Angkor Wat mean? Answer:",
