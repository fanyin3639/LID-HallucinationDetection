    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: In photometry, luminous intensity is a measure of the wavelength-weighted power emitted by a light source in a particular direction per unit solid angle, based on the luminosity function, a standardized model of the sensitivity of the human eye. The SI unit of luminous intensity is the candela(cd), an SI base unit. Question: What unit of measurement is used to measure light intensity? Answer:",
