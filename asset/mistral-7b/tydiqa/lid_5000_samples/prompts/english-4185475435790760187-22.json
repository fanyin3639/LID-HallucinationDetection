    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The T-44A officially entered service with the Red Army on 23 November 1944 but the production started in October.[12] Production took place at the new Factory No. 75 (Zavod 75) in Kharkiv which used the buildings of the old KhPZ Factory No. 183 which were recaptured from Germans on 23 August 1943.[12] To restore the factories  to working order, engineers, workers, machines and tools were sent from Stalin Ural Tank Factory No. 183, located in Nizhny Tagil.[12] The original plans were that the factory would produce 300 T-44As a month. However, only 25 were built by the end of 1944. In 1945, 940 were built, making a total of 965 (190[12] tanks built in 1944 and 1945 were completed by the end of the war). An additional 858 T-44As were made in 1946-1947. The T-34 continued to account for 85% of medium tank production through 1950,[16] and development of a more advanced medium tank with a more powerful 100mm gun proceeded. The relatively brief production run ended in 1947 with a total of 1,823 T-44A tanks built. The reasons for such a brief production run included mechanical teething problems,[17] the end of the war which reduced the Red Army's need for a new tank,[17] and the design's inability to successfully fit a 100mm tank gun.[17] It was replaced on the production lines by the T-54-1 main battle tank, which was more mechanically reliable and could mount a 100mm gun. The superior T-54-2 would replace T-34 production at the Omsk Factory No. 183 in 1950, and the T-54/55 main battle tank series would remain in production until 1981.[2][8] Question: How many T-44 tanks did the Soviet Union produce?
