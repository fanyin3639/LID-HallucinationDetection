    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The Mexican\u2013American War,[lower-alpha 1] also known in the United States as the Mexican War and in Mexico as the American intervention in Mexico,[lower-alpha 2] was an armed conflict between the United States of America and the United Mexican States (Mexico) from 1846 to 1848.

The unstable Mexican caudillo leadership of President/General Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna still considered Texas to be its northeastern province and never recognized the Republic of Texas, which had seceded a decade earlier. In 1845, newly elected U.S. President James K. Polk sent troops to the disputed area and a diplomatic mission to Mexico. After Mexican forces attacked American forces, Polk cited this in his request that Congress declare war. Question: What years was the Mexican-American War? Answer:",
