    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: From just over 45,000 residents in 1800, Ohio's population grew at rates of over 10% per decade (except for the 1940 census) until the 1970 census, which recorded just over 10.65 million Ohioans.[68] Growth then slowed for the next four decades.[69]  The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Ohio was 11,689,442 on July 1, 2018, a 1.33% increase since the 2010 United States Census.[67]  Ohio's population growth lags that of the entire United States, and Caucasians are found in a greater density than the United States average. As of 2000, Ohio's center of population is located in Morrow County,[70] in the county seat of Mount Gilead.[71] This is approximately 6,346 feet (1,934m) south and west of Ohio's population center in 1990.[70] Question: How many people live in Ohio?
