    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Louis Plack Hammett (April 7, 1894 \u2013 February 9, 1987) was an American physical chemist. He is known for the Hammett equation, which relates reaction rates to equilibrium constants for certain classes of organic reactions involving substituted aromatic compounds. He is also known for his research into superacids and his development of a scheme for comparing their acidities based on what is now known as the Hammett acidity function. The Curtin\u2013Hammett principle bears his name. Question: When did Louis Hammett die? Answer:",
