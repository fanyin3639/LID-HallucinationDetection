    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: HBO's Game of Thrones has included in its adaptation many of the \"hints\" identified by this theory.[33] In the season 6 finale, \"The Winds of Winter\", Bran Stark has a vision of the past which shows Ned reuniting with a dying Lyanna in the Tower of Joy. Lyanna makes him promise to protect her son\u2014Jon.[33][34][35] An infographic subsequently posted on the HBO-controlled website MakingGameofThrones.com confirmed Rhaegar as Jon's father.[36][37][38] Journalists later commented on the significance of two plot points in the season 7 episode \"Eastwatch\". One of Daenerys Targaryen's dragons, Drogon, approaches Jon calmly and allows the King in the North to pet him, seemingly recognizing him as a Targaryen.[39][40][41] Later, Gilly learns from a book at the Citadel that a High Septon annulled Rhaegar's marriage, and married him to someone else in Dorne, suggesting the possibility that Jon is the legitimate son of Rhaegar and Lyanna.[42][43][44] The season 7 finale episode \"The Dragon and the Wolf\" confirmed that Jon is indeed the legitimate son of Rhaegar and Lyanna, and that his birth name is actually Aegon Targaryen.[45][46] Question: Who is Jon Snow's father?
