The small intestine has three distinct regions \u2013 the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The duodenum is the shortest part of the small intestine and is where preparation for absorption begins. It also receives bile and pancreatic juice through the pancreatic duct, controlled by the sphincter of Oddi.  The primary function of the small intestine is the absorption of nutrients and minerals from food, using small finger-like protrusions called villi.[2] Question: What are the parts of the small intestine?
