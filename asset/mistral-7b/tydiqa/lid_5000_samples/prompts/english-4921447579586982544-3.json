    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The brand was introduced in 1955 by McNeil Laboratories, a family owned pharmaceutical manufacturer.  Two brothers took over the company from their father that year, and that year one of them learned about paracetamol, which was not on the US market at that time. To avoid competing with aspirin, they marketed it as a product to reduce fever in children, packaging it like a red fire truck with the slogan, \"for little hotheads\".   The name \"Tylenol\" and the generic name \"acetaminophen\" were generated by McNeil from the chemical name of the drug.  Johnson & Johnson bought McNeil in 1959, and one year later the drug was made available over the counter.[7] Question: When was Tylenol introduced? Answer:",
