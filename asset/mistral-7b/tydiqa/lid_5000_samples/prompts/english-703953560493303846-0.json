    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Judo(wikt:\u67d4\u9053,j\u016bd\u014d, meaning \"gentle way\") was originally created in 1882 by Jigoro Kano (\u5609\u7d0d\u6cbb\u4e94\u90ce) as a physical, mental and moral pedagogy in Japan. It is generally categorized as a modern martial art, which later evolved into a combat and Olympic sport. Its most prominent feature is its competitive element, where the objective is to either throw or takedown an opponent to the ground, immobilize or otherwise subdue an opponent with a pin, or force an opponent to submit with a joint lock or a choke. Strikes and thrusts by hands and feet as well as weapons defenses are a part of judo, but only in pre-arranged forms (kata, \u5f62) and are not allowed in judo competition or free practice (randori, \u4e71\u53d6\u308a). A judo practitioner is called a judoka. Question: What is the origin of the word Judo? Answer:",
