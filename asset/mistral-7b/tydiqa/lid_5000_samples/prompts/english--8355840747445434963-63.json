Passage: I'm Not Stiller started with a print-run that provided for sales of 3,000 in its first year,[77] but thanks to strong and growing reader demand it later became the first book published by Suhrkamp to top one million copies.[80] The next novel, Homo Faber, was another best seller, with four million copies of the German language version produced by 1998.[81] The Fire Raisers and Andorra are the most successful German language plays of all time, with respectively 250 and 230 productions up till 1996, according to an estimate made by the literary critic Volker Hage.[82] The two plays, along with Homo Faber became curriculum favourites with schools in the German-speaking middle European countries. Apart from a few early works, most of Frisch's books and plays have been translated into around ten languages, while the most translated of all, Homo Faber, has been translated into twenty-five languages.
