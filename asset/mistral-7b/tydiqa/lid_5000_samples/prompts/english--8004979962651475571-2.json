    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: After Prithvi Narayan Shah unified all small principalities of Nepal, the double-pennon flag was adopted. In modern times, the flag's symbolism has evolved to incorporate several meanings. The crimson red indicates the bravery of Nepali people and is the country's national colour and the blue border represents peace and harmony. The colours are often found in Nepalese decoration and works of art.[2] The triangular shape of the pennons originally represented the Himalayas, with their sizing denoting important families - Shahs for the upper, and the Ranas below. Another theory is that the two points represented peace and hard work, using the symbols of the moon and sun respectively. However, the modern and government sanctioned representation is of Hinduism and Buddhism, the main religions of the country.[4][5] Question: Who designed the flag of Nepal? Answer:",
