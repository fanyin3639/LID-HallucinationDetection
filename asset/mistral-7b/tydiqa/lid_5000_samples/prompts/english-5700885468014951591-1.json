    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: L\u00fc Meng was from Fupo County (\u5bcc\u9642\u7e23), Runan Commandery (\u6c5d\u5357\u90e1), which is located southeast of present-day Funan County, Anhui. His family migrated to the south of the Yangtze River when L\u00fc Meng was young. L\u00fc Meng lived with his brother-in-law, Deng Dang (\u9127\u7576), who served as a military officer under Sun Ce. When he was 14 or 15, he secretly followed Deng Dang to the battles against the Shanyue tribes. Deng Dang was shocked to see his teenage brother-in-law in battle, so he scolded L\u00fc Meng and warned him to stop. L\u00fc Meng refused to listen so Deng Dang told L\u00fc Meng's mother about this. When she wanted to punish him, L\u00fc Meng said: \"It is difficult to survive in poverty. If we can prove ourselves through hard work, then wealth will come eventually. How can we catch the tiger cub if we don't enter the tiger's den?\" L\u00fc Meng's mother sighed and let him have his way.[Sanguozhi 2] Question: Where did Ziming come from? Answer:",
