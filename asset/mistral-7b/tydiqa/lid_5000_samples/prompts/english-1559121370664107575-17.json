    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Differing in situ values have been reported for the average temperature on Mars,[21] with a common value being \u221263\u00b0C (210K; \u221281\u00b0F).[22][23]  Surface temperatures may reach a high of about 20\u00b0C (293K; 68\u00b0F) at noon, at the equator, and a low of about \u2212153\u00b0C (120K; \u2212243\u00b0F) at the poles.[24] Actual temperature measurements at the Viking landers' site range from \u221217.2\u00b0C (256.0K; 1.0\u00b0F) to \u2212107\u00b0C (166K; \u2212161\u00b0F). The warmest soil temperature estimated by the Viking Orbiter was 27\u00b0C (300K; 81\u00b0F).[25] The Spirit rover recorded a maximum daytime air temperature in the shade of 35\u00b0C (308K; 95\u00b0F), and regularly recorded temperatures well above 0\u00b0C (273K; 32\u00b0F), except in winter.[26] Question: What is the temperature on Mars?
