    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The 5' 4\" welterweight Hollandersky lost to Panama Joe, the younger and stronger Panamanian Light and Middleweight champion, and the accomplished middleweight Connors of Scranton, Pennsylvania, who had a five-inch height advantage.  But he gave a closer fight to the Seattle welterweight Ryan before an impressive crowd of 1500 at the Savannah Club in Ancon, Panama on February 23, 1914.  The Panamanian fans voiced their disapproval of the referee's Draw ruling as Hollandersky appeared to have landed more blows.[82] The Norwich Bulletin felt Hollandersky had the edge in the Ryan bout which they referred to as a \"Welterweight Championship of the Isthmus.\" Perhaps as a result, Abe's fight records at the end of his autobiography and Nat Fleischer's 1944 Ring Record Book referred to Hollandersky as a Welterweight Champion of Panama, though his actual title was heavyweight champion.[83] Question: How tall was Abe \"The Newsboy\" Hollandersky? Answer:",
