    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The designation is not used with strict consistency. In some cases it refers broadly to what is otherwise known as the art of memory, the origins of which are related, according to tradition, in the story of Simonides of Ceos and the collapsing banquet hall.[20] For example, after relating the story of how Simonides relied on remembered seating arrangements to call to mind the faces of recently deceased guests, Stephen M. Kosslyn remarks \"[t]his insight led to the development of a technique the Greeks called the method of loci, which is a systematic way of improving one's memory by using imagery.\"[21] Skoyles and Sagan indicate that \"an ancient technique of memorization called Method of Loci, by which memories are referenced directly onto spatial maps\" originated with the story of Simonides.[22] Referring to mnemonic methods, Verlee Williams mentions, \"One such strategy is the 'loci' method, which was developed by Simonides, a Greek poet of the fifth and sixth centuries BC.\"[23] Loftus cites the foundation story of Simonides (more or less taken from Frances Yates) and describes some of the most basic aspects of the use of space in the art of memory. She states, \"This particular mnemonic technique has come to be called the \"method of loci\".[24] While place or position certainly figured prominently in ancient mnemonic techniques, no designation equivalent to \"method of loci\" was used exclusively to refer to mnemonic schemes relying upon space for organization.[25] Question: Who developed the Mind Palace technique of memorization?
