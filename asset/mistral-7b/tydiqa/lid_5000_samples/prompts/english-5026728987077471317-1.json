Passage: Starting with the T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen (515.4km, 320.3mi) in 1964,[3] the network has expanded to currently consist of 2,764.6km (1,717.8mi) of lines with maximum speeds of 240\u2013320km/h (150\u2013200mph), 283.5km (176.2mi) of Mini-Shinkansen lines with a maximum speed of 130km/h (80mph), and 10.3km (6.4mi) of spur lines with Shinkansen services.[4] The network presently links most major cities on the islands of Honshu and Kyushu, and Hakodate on northern island of Hokkaido, with an extension to Sapporo under construction and scheduled to commence in March 2031.[5] The maximum operating speed is 320km/h (200mph) (on a 387.5km section of the T\u014dhoku Shinkansen).[6] Test runs have reached 443km/h (275mph) for conventional rail in 1996, and up to a world record 603km/h (375mph) for SCMaglev trains in April 2015.[7] Question: How fast to bullet trains travel?
