    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The Mexican Revolution (Spanish: Revoluci\u00f3n mexicana), also known as the Mexican Civil War (Spanish: guerra civil mexicana), was a major armed struggle, lasting roughly from 1910 to 1920, that radically transformed Mexican culture and government. Although recent research has focused on local and regional aspects of the Revolution, it was a genuinely national revolution.[4] Its outbreak in 1910 resulted from the failure of the 35-year-long regime of Porfirio D\u00edaz to find a managed solution to the presidential succession. This meant there was a political crisis among competing elites and the opportunity for agrarian insurrection.[5] Wealthy landowner Francisco I. Madero challenged D\u00edaz in the 1910 presidential election, and following the rigged results, revolted under the Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed.[6] Armed conflict ousted D\u00edaz from power; a new election was held in 1911, bringing Madero to the presidency. Question: How long did the Mexican Revolution last? Answer:",
