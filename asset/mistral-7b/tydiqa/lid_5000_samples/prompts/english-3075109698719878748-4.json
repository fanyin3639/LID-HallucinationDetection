Passage: According to K\u0101retu, the haka has been \"erroneously defined by generations of uninformed as 'war dances'\",[12] whereas M\u0101ori mythology places haka as the dance \"about the celebration of life\".[13] According to its creation story, the sun god, Tama-nui-te-r\u0101, had two wives, the Summer Maid, Hine-raumati, and the Winter Maid, Hine-takurua. Haka originated in the coming of Hine-raumati, whose presence on still, hot days was revealed in a quivering appearance in the air. This was the haka of T\u0101ne-rore, the son of Hine-raumati and Tama-nui-te-r\u0101.[14][15] Hyland comments that \"[t]he haka is (and also represents) a natural phenomena; on hot summer days, the 'shimmering' atmospheric distortion of air emanating from the ground is personified as 'Te Haka a T\u0101nerore'\".[16] Question: What does a hakka symbolize?
