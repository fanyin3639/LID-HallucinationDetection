    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Ductility can be quantified by the fracture strain      \u03b5  f     {\\displaystyle \\varepsilon _{f}}  , which is the engineering strain at which a test specimen fractures during a uniaxial tensile test. Another commonly used measure is the reduction of area at fracture     q   {\\displaystyle q}  .[5] The ductility of steel varies depending on the alloying constituents. Increasing the levels of carbon decreases ductility. Many plastics and amorphous solids, such as Play-Doh, are also malleable. The most ductile metal is platinum and the most malleable metal is gold.[6][7] Question: What's the most malleable metal? Answer:",
