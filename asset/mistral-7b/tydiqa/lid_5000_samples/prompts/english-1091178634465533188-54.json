    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: One effort to quantify the population gave a \"rough estimate\" that 0.3 percent of adults in the US are transgender, overlapping to an unknown degree with the estimated 3.5 percent of US adults (1-in-30) who identify as LGBT.[128][129] More recent studies released in 2016 estimate the proportion of Americans who identify as transgender at 0.5 to 0.6%. This would put the total number of transgender Americans at approximately 1.4 million adults (as of 2016).[130][131][132][133] Question: How many trans-gendered people are in the USA? Answer:",
