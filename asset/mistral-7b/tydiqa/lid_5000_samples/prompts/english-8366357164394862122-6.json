    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: In October 1745, Ewald Georg von Kleist of Pomerania, Germany, found that charge could be stored by connecting a high-voltage electrostatic generator by a wire to a volume of water in a hand-held glass jar.[4] Von Kleist's hand and the water acted as conductors, and the jar as a dielectric (although details of the mechanism were incorrectly identified at the time). Von Kleist found that touching the wire resulted in a powerful spark, much more painful than that obtained from an electrostatic machine. The following year, the Dutch physicist Pieter van Musschenbroek invented a similar capacitor, which was named the Leyden jar, after the University of Leiden where he worked.[5]  He also was impressed by the power of the shock he received, writing, \"I would not take a second shock for the kingdom of France.\"[6] Question: Who developed the capacitor? Answer:",
