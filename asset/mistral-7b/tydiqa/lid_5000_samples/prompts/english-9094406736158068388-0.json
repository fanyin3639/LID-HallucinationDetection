    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Charlie Brown (also known as Charles Brown, Esq. and nicknamed Chuck by Peppermint Patty) is the lead role of the comic strip Peanuts, syndicated in daily and Sunday newspapers in numerous countries all over the world. Depicted as a \"lovable loser,\" Charlie Brown is one of the great American archetypes and a popular and widely recognized cartoon character. Charlie Brown is characterized as a person who frequently suffers, and as a result is usually nervous and lacks self-confidence. He shows both pessimistic and optimistic attitudes: on some days, he is reluctant to go out because his day might just be spoiled, but on others, he hopes for the best and tries as much as he can to accomplish things. He is easily recognized by his trademark zigzag patterned shirt. There is only one exception:  whenever he's a costumed character, he wears a red baseball cap on top of his head most of the time, rather than just wearing a white one during baseball seasons in comic strips and animation. Question: Who is Charlie Brown? Answer:",
