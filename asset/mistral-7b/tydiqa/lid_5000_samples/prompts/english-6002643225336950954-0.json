    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The atmosphere of Venus is the layer of gases surrounding Venus. It is composed primarily of carbon dioxide and is much denser and hotter than that of Earth. The temperature at the surface is 740K (467\u00b0C, 872\u00b0F), and the pressure is 93bar (9.3MPa), roughly the pressure found 900m (3,000ft) underwater on Earth.[1] The Venusian atmosphere supports opaque clouds made of sulfuric acid, making optical Earth-based and orbital observation of the surface impossible. Information about the topography has been obtained exclusively by radar imaging.[1] Aside from carbon dioxide, the other main component is nitrogen. Other chemical compounds are present only in trace amounts.[1] Question: What is the temperature of Venus' atmosphere? Answer:",
