    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The first depictions of the supernatural on screen appear in several of the short silent films created by the French pioneer filmmaker Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s in the late 1890s. The best known of these supernatural-based works is the 3-minute short film Le Manoir du Diable (1896), also known in English as The Haunted Castle or The House of the Devil. The film is sometimes credited as being the first ever horror film.[7] In The Haunted Castle, a mischievous devil appears inside a medieval castle and harasses the visitors. M\u00e9li\u00e8s' other popular horror film is La Caverne maudite (1898), which translates literally to \"the accursed cave\". The film, also known for its English title The Cave of the Demons, tells the story of a woman stumbling over a cave that is populated by the spirits and skeletons of people who died there.[7] M\u00e9li\u00e8s would also make other short films that historians consider now as horror-comedies. Une nuit terrible (1896), which translates to A Terrible Night, tells a story of a man who tries to get a good night's sleep but ends up wrestling a giant spider. His other film, L'auberge ensorcel\u00e9e (1897), or The Bewitched Inn, features a story of a hotel guest getting pranked and tormented by an unseen presence.[8] Question: What was the first ever horror movie?
