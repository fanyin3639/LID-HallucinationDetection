    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The name \"Haflinger\" comes from the village of Hafling, which today is in northern Italy.[1] The breed is also called the Avelignese, from the Italian name for Hafling, which is Avelengo or previously Aveligna.[2] Haflingers are always chestnut in color[3] and come in shades ranging from a light gold to a rich golden chestnut or liver hue.  The mane and tail are white or flaxen.[4] The height of the breed has increased since the end of World War II, when it stood an average of 13.3hands (55inches, 140cm).[5] The desired height today is between 13.2 and 15hands (54 and 60inches, 137 and 152cm). Breeders are discouraged from breeding horses under the minimum size, but taller individuals may pass inspection if they otherwise meet requirements of the breed registry.  The breed has a refined head and light poll.  The neck is of medium length, the withers are pronounced, the shoulders sloping and the chest deep. The back is medium-long and muscular, the croup is long, slightly sloping and well-muscled. The legs are clean, with broad, flat knees and powerful hocks showing clear definition of tendons and ligaments.[4] The Haflinger has rhythmic, ground-covering gaits. The walk is relaxed but energetic. The trot and canter are elastic, energetic, and athletic with a natural tendency to be light on the forehand and balanced. There is some knee action, and the canter has a very distinct motion forwards and upwards.[3] One important consideration in breeding during the second half of the 20th century was temperament. A requirement for a quiet, kind nature has become part of official breed standards and is checked during official inspections.[6] Some sources recognize two types of Haflinger, a shorter, heavier type used for draft work and a taller, lighter type used for pleasure riding, light driving and under-saddle competition.[7][8] The Food and Agriculture Organization recognizes both an \"Avelignese\" and an \"Avelignese Tradizionale\" as existing in Italy, although, as of 2007, only 13 of the latter existed, including only one breeding stallion.[9][10] However, all breed organizations recognize and register only one type.
