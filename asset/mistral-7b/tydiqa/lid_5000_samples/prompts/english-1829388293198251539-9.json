    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Archaeological evidence suggests that pigs were domesticated from wild boar as early as 13,000\u201312,700 BC in the Near East in the Tigris Basin,[15] \u00c7ay\u00f6n\u00fc, Cafer H\u00f6y\u00fck, Neval\u0131 \u00c7ori[16] being managed in the wild in a way similar to the way they are managed by some modern New Guineans.[17] Remains of pigs have been dated to earlier than 11,400 BC in Cyprus. Those animals must have been introduced from the mainland, which suggests domestication in the adjacent mainland by then.[18] There was also a separate domestication in China which took place about 8000 years ago.[19][20] Question: When was the pig first domesticated? Answer:",
