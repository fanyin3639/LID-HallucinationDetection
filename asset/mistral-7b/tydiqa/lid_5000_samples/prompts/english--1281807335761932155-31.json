    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The ability to view and characterize different neural cells including microglia began in 1880 when Nissl staining was developed by Franz Nissl. Franz Nissl and F. Robertson first described microglial cells during their histology experiments. The cell staining techniques in the 1880s showed that microglia are related to macrophages. The activation of microglia and formation of ramified microglial clusters was first noted by Victor Babe\u015f while studying a rabies case in 1897. Babe\u015f noted the cells were found in a variety of viral brain infections but did not know what the clusters of microglia he saw were.[30] P\u00edo del R\u00edo Hortega, a student of Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal, first called the cells \"microglia\" around 1920. He went on to characterize microglial response to brain lesions in 1927 and note the \"fountains of microglia\" present in the corpus callosum and other perinatal white matter areas in 1932. After many years of research Rio-Hortega became generally considered as the \"Father of Microglia.\"[31][32] For a long period of time little improvement was made in our knowledge of microglia. Then, in 1988, Hickey and Kimura showed that perivascular microglial cells are bone-marrow derived, and express high levels of MHC class II proteins used for antigen presentation. This confirmed Pio Del Rio-Hortega's postulate that microglial cells functioned similarly to macrophages by performing phagocytosis and antigen presentation. Question: How was microglia discovered? Answer:",
