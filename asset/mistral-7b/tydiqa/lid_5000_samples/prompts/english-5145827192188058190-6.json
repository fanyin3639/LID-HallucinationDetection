    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage:  Before joining the major leagues, Hogan played for minor league baseball teams in the northeastern United States, including the Akron (Ohio) Summits[17] and Scranton (Pennsylvania) Miners.[18] He began his career as a major league player with the Cincinnati Reds, on August 4, 1894, but played only six games before switching to the St. Louis Browns (later known as the Cardinals). By this time, St. Louis had been eliminated from league championship contention, after being tied with Cleveland and Boston for first place in April.[19] Hogan participated in 29 games with St. Louis in the 1894 season. According to the 1895 edition of Spalding's Official Baseball Guide, he ranked tenth among league outfielders with a percentage of .941 for put-outs, assists, and errors.[20] Among his teammates, Hogan held the second highest percentage of stolen bases for games played.[19]  In March 1895, a reporter for Sporting Life praised the Browns' decision to retain Hogan in center field and emphasized the young outfielder's potential.[21]  \"On the bases and in the field the lad is a wonder\", the paper stated.  \"His only fault is weakness at the bat, but increasing confidence and familiarity with [National] League players will undoubtedly improve him in this respect\".[21]  Despite Hogan's physical speed, however, his overall performance with the Browns proved uneven, and his two-season batting average was just .241.[22] On May 17, 1895, the Youngstown Daily Vindicator reported that Hogan had been \"farmed out\" as a center fielder to the Indianapolis Hoosiers, a club connected to the well-organized Western League,[23] the predecessor of the American League.[24]  The Vindicator added, \"At any time by giving a proper notification the St. Louis team, of which club Hogan is a member, can again secure his services\".[23] Yet, for reasons that are unclear, Hogan never returned to the St. Louis Browns.  He played his last game with the team on April 24, 1895,[22] concluding a major-league career that comprised 40 games over two seasons.[25] Question: When did Martin Francis Hogan join Major League Baseball?
