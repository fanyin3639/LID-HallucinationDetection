    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Immanuel Kant (/k\u00e6nt/;[15] German:[\u0294\u026a\u02c8ma\u02d0nu\u032fe\u02d0l \u02c8kant, -nu\u032f\u025bl -];[16][17] 22 April 1724\u2013 12 February 1804) was a German philosopher who is a central figure in modern philosophy.[18] In his doctrine of transcendental idealism, he argued that space, time and causation are mere sensibilities; \"things-in-themselves\" exist, but their nature is unknowable.[19][20] In his view, the mind shapes and structures experience, with all human experience sharing certain structural features. He drew a parallel to the Copernican revolution in his proposition that worldly objects can be intuited a priori (\"beforehand\"), and that intuition is therefore independent from objective reality.[21] Kant believed that reason is the source of morality, and that aesthetics arise from a faculty of disinterested judgment. Kant's views continue to have a major influence on contemporary philosophy, especially the fields of epistemology, ethics, political theory, and post-modern aesthetics. Question: When was Kant born?
