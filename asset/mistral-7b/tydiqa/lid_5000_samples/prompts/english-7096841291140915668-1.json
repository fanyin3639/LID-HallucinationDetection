    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The No. 17 Porsche 919 Hybrid of Timo Bernhard, Brendon Hartley and Mark Webber qualified in pole position by setting the fastest lap in class. They maintained the lead for the opening 80 minutes until they suffered a terminal rear drivetrain failure. This allowed the sister No. 18 car driven by Marc Lieb, Neel Jani and Romain Dumas to take over first position. Thereafter, the crew of the No. 18 Porsche battled the No. 7 Audi R18 e-tron quattro of Andr\u00e9 Lotterer, Marcel F\u00e4ssler and Beno\u00eet Tr\u00e9luyer for the lead throughout much of the event. This led to multiple overtakes by the No. 7 team that were repelled soon after by the No. 18 Porsche team. It had the advantage of being faster in a straight line, but the Audi was better in the track's corners. Although the No. 7 Audi served a ten-second stop-and-go penalty for a track limits transgression in the final fourteen minutes of the event, it eventually got ahead as it was on a different strategy to the No. 18 Porsche. The car maintained the lead for the rest of the race to clinch the ninth overall career victory for Lotterer, F\u00e4ssler and Tr\u00e9luyer in a record-breaking race distance of 201 laps. Lieb, Dumas and Jani finished second and the No. 1 Toyota TS040 Hybrid of S\u00e9bastien Buemi, Kazuki Nakajima and Anthony Davidson came in third.
