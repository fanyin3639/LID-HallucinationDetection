The name \"Rupiah\" is derived from the Indian word rupiya (\u0930\u0941\u092a\u0940\u092f\u093e), ultimately from Sanskrit rupyakam (\u0930\u0942\u092a\u094d\u092f\u0915\u092e\u094d; silver). Informally, Indonesians also use the word \"perak\" (\"silver\" in Indonesian) in referring to rupiah. The rupiah is subdivided into 100 sen, although inflation has rendered all coins and banknotes denominated in sen obsolete. Question: What currency do they spend in Indonesia? Answer:",
