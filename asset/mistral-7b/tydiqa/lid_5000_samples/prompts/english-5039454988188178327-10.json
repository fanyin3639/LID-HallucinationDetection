    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Differences between the three regions are dramatic. The Northern Caspian only includes the Caspian shelf,[15] and is very shallow; it accounts for less than 1% of the total water volume with an average depth of only 5\u20136 metres (16\u201320ft). The sea noticeably drops off towards the Middle Caspian, where the average depth is 190 metres (620ft).[14] The Southern Caspian is the deepest, with oceanic depths of over 1,000 metres (3,300ft), greatly exceeding the depth of other regional seas, such as the Persian Gulf. The Middle and Southern Caspian account for 33% and 66% of the total water volume, respectively.[12] The northern portion of the Caspian Sea typically freezes in the winter, and in the coldest winters ice forms in the south as well.[16] Question: What is the deepest point in the Caspian Sea? Answer:",
