    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Ion C\u0103lug\u0103ru (Romanian pronunciation:[i\u02c8on k\u0259\u02c8lu\u0261\u0259ru]; born \u0218trul Leiba Croitoru,[1] also known as Buium sin Strul-Leiba Croitoru,[2] B. Croitoru;[3][4][5] February 14, 1902 \u2013 May 22, 1956) was a Romanian novelist, short story writer, journalist and critic. As a figure on Romania's modernist scene throughout the early interwar period, he was noted for combining a picturesque perspective on the rural Jewish-Romanian community, to which he belonged, with traditionalist and avant-garde elements. His early works, including the novel Copil\u0103ria unui netrebnic (\"The Childhood of a Ne'er-do-well\"), bring together elements of Social Realism, Surrealism and Expressionism over a conventional narrative line based on oral tradition and the classics of Romanian literature. C\u0103lug\u0103ru, who moved from the moderate Contimporanul magazine to the Surrealist platform unu, was also one of the main contributors to Integral, a tribune for avant-garde literature in general. Although publicly known for his socialist convictions and his far left inclinations, he was, through his position at Cuv\u00e2ntul newspaper, present in the proximity of fascist circles, and had an ambiguous attitude toward his employer, the far right thinker Nae Ionescu. Question: When was Ion C\u0103lug\u0103ru born? Answer:",
