    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Sea urchins or urchins (/\u02c8\u025c\u02d0rt\u0283\u026anz/) are typically spiny, globular animals, echinoderms in the class Echinoidea. About 950 species live on the seabed, inhabiting all oceans and depth zones from the intertidal to 5,000 metres (16,000ft; 2,700 fathoms).[1] Their tests (hard shells) are round and spiny, typically from 3 to 10cm (1 to 4in) across. Sea urchins move slowly, crawling with their tube feet, and sometimes pushing themselves with their spines. They feed primarily on algae but also eat slow-moving or sessile animals. Their predators include sea otters, starfish, wolf eels, and triggerfish. Question: How many species of sea urchin are there? Answer:",
