    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Velocity is a physical vector quantity; both magnitude and direction are needed to define it. The scalar absolute value (magnitude) of velocity is called speed, being a coherent derived unit whose quantity is measured in the SI (metric system) as metres per second (m/s) or as the SI base unit of (m\u22c5s\u22121). For example, \"5 metres per second\" is a scalar, whereas \"5 metres per second east\" is a vector.  If there is a change in speed, direction or both, then the object has a changing velocity and is said to be undergoing an acceleration. Question: What unit is used to measure velocity? Answer:",
