    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The oldest known mentions of an \"Atlantic\" sea come from Stesichorus around mid-sixth century BC (Sch. A. R. 1. 211):[6] Atlantikoi pel\u00e1gei (Greek: \u1f08\u03c4\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff7 \u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03ac\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9; English: 'the Atlantic sea'; etym. 'Sea of Atlantis') and in The Histories of Herodotus around 450 BC (Hdt. 1.202.4): Atlantis thalassa (Greek: \u1f08\u03c4\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u1f76\u03c2 \u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1; English: 'Sea of Atlantis' or 'the Atlantis sea'[7]) where the name refers to \"the sea beyond the pillars of Heracles\" which is said to be part of the sea that surrounds all land.[8]  Thus, on one hand, the name refers to Atlas, the Titan in Greek mythology, who supported the heavens and who later appeared as a frontispiece in Medieval maps and also lent his name to modern atlases.[9]  On the other hand, to early Greek sailors and in Ancient Greek mythological literature such as the Iliad and the Odyssey, this all-encompassing ocean was instead known as Oceanus, the gigantic river that encircled the world; in contrast to the enclosed seas well known to the Greeks: the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.[10] In contrast, the term \"Atlantic\" originally referred specifically to the Atlas Mountains in Morocco and the sea off the Strait of Gibraltar and the North African coast.[9] The Greek word thalassa has been reused by scientists for the huge Panthalassa ocean that surrounded the supercontinent Pangaea hundreds of millions of years ago. Question: Why is it called the Atlantic Ocean? Answer:",
