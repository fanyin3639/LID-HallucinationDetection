    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: In absolute numbers, South Africa (7.1 million), followed by Nigeria (3.2 million), and India (2.1 million) had the highest HIV/AIDS number of cases by the end of 2016.[6][7] While South Africa's large population of HIV-positive people is attributable to its high disease prevalence (18.9%, one of the highest in the world), Nigeria's is lower at 2.9%, with India's prevalence rate at 0.3%.[1]. However, countries such as Nigeria with high HIV rates above 1% are classified as having Generalized HIV Epidemics (GHEs) by UNAIDS, while India's prevalence is well below this threshold, with a prevalence lower than America's and about the same as France [8].
