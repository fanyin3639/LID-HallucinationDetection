    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Gestation in a dog is 63 days in length, if measured from the day of ovulation. Since it is difficult to determine the exact date of ovulation, errors are often made in calculating gestation period.[19] Canine sperm can live for 10 to 11 days [20]  in the uterine tubes (fallopian tubes) so if a female is bred 10 days before the oocytes (eggs) can be fertilized, she will appear to have a gestation length of 70 days. If she is bred on the day the oocytes can be fertilized, her gestation length will appear to be 60 days long. Question: What is the normal gestation period for a dog? Answer:",
