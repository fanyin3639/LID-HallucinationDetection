Hidell\", purchased by mail order a 6.5\u00d752mm Carcano Model 91/38 infantry rifle (described by the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy as a \"Mannlicher\u2013Carcano\") rifle with a telescopic sight.[1] He also purchased a revolver from a different company, by the same method. The Hidell alias was determined from multiple sources to be Oswald.[2] Oswald fired the rifle from the Texas School Book Depository in Dallas, Texas, to assassinate U.S. President John F. Kennedy as his motorcade drove by on November 22, 1963.[3] Photographs of Oswald holding the rifle, a palmprint found upon examination of the rifle, and detective work tracing its sale, all eventually led to Oswald.[4] Marina Oswald later testified she was told by Lee that the rifle was also used before in an attempt to assassinate retired U.S. Army General Edwin Walker in Dallas.
