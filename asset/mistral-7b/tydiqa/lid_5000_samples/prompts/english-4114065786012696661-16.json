    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: According to another theory,[38] Constance was the daughter of Duke Przemys\u0142aw of Racib\u00f3rz and his wife Anna, daughter of Duke Konrad II of Czersk. Probably born before 1307,[39] is understood that she was the youngest child of Ducal couple. She probably named after Constance, Abbess of Trzebnica and daughter of Duke Ziemomys\u0142 of Inowroclaw, while her  brother, Leszek, was named after Leszek II the Black (Ziemomys\u0142's brother). Constance probably never married. Until her death in 1351 she lived in Wodzis\u0142aw \u015al\u0105ski, which certainly represented her personal fief. Question: When did Constance, the Duchess of Wodzis\u0142aw \u015al\u0105ski die? Answer:",
