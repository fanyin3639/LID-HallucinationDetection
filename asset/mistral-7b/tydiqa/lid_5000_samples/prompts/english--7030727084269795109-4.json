    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: In the early 1950s, Alexander Todd\u2019s group pioneered H-phosphonate and phosphate triester methods of oligonucleotide synthesis.[5][6] The reaction of compounds 1 and 2 to form H-phosphonate diester 3 is an H-phosphonate coupling in solution while that of compounds 4 and 5 to give 6 is a phosphotriester coupling (see phosphotriester synthesis below). Question: Who first identified the process of oligonucleotide synthesis? Answer:",
