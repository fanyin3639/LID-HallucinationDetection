    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Screenwriter and director Brad Bird conceived Violet as \"a teenage girl who just wants to be invisible\".[2] In early drafts of the screenplay, Violet is depicted as an infant as opposed to a teenager, since parents Bob and Helen Parr were originally intended to be introduced as retired superheroes who have just begun to attempt to live normal lives much earlier during the film.[3][4] Violet is voiced by American author and actress Sarah Vowell, who related that she was offered the role unexpectedly.[5] While beginning to cast the film's main characters, Bird had been listening to the National Public Radio program This American Life, to which Vowell is a frequent contributor.[2][6][7] During one of Vowell's regular appearances on the show,[2] Bird heard her contribute an anecdote about a cannon she had helped her father, a gunsmith, build.[8][5] Bird wanted to cast Vowell based on her description of the event,[5] deciding that she was \"perfect\" for the part and immediately calling her to offer her the role.[2] Vowell had already earned a reputation for declining several voice acting jobs prior to The Incredibles, to the point at which her agent warned Bird, \"She's a serious writer and she wouldn't do this, so don't waste your time!\"[6] However, Vowell states that she simply avoided pursuing animated roles in general because she was content being a writer and found few animated projects particularly interesting prior to The Incredibles.[9] Question: Who played the voice of Violet Parr in The Incredibles?
