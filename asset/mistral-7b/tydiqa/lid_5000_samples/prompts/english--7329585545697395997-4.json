    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Forrest J Ackerman is credited with first using the term \"Sci-Fi\" (analogous to the then-trendy \"hi-fi\") in 1954.[9] As science fiction entered popular culture, writers and fans active in the field came to associate the term with low-budget, low-tech \"B-movies\" and with low-quality pulp science fiction.[10][11][12] By the 1970s, critics within the field such as Knight and Terry Carr were using sci-fi to distinguish hack-work from serious science fiction.[13] Peter Nicholls writes that \"SF\" (or \"sf\") is \"the preferred abbreviation within the community of sf writers and readers\".[14] Robert Heinlein found even \"science fiction\" insufficient and suggested the term speculative fiction to be used instead, which has continued to be applied to \"serious\" or \"thoughtful\" science fiction. Question: When did feminist science fiction become popular? Answer:",
