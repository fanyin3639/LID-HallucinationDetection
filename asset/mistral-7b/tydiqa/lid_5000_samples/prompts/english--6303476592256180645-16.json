    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The architect or architects of this innovative project remain unknown due to a lack of contemporary sources. Giorgio Vasari in his Lives attributed all the important papal projects in Rome during Sixtus IV to a Florentine, Baccio Pontelli including the basilica and monastery of Santa Maria del Popolo. Modern researchers deemed this claim highly dubious and proposed other names among them Andrea Bregno, a Lombard sculptor and architect whose workshop certainly received important commissions in the basilica. The fundamental differences between the fa\u00e7ade and the interior suggest that maybe more than one architect was working on the building.[19] Question: Who led in rebuilding the Basilica Santa Maria del Popolo? Answer:",
