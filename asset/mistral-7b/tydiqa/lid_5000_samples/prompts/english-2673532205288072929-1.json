    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: In quantum computing, a qubit(/\u02c8kju\u02d0b\u026at/)or quantum bit(sometimes qbit) is the basic unit of quantum information\u2014the quantum version of the classical binary bit physically realized with a two-state device.  A qubit is a two-state (or two-level) quantum-mechanical system, one of the simplest quantum systems displaying the peculiarity of quantum mechanics.  Examples include: the spin of the electron in which the two levels can be taken as spin up and spin down; or the polarization of a single photon in which the two states can be taken to be the vertical polarization and the horizontal polarization. In a classical system, a bit would have to be in one state or the other. However, quantum mechanics allows the qubit to be in a coherent superpositionof both states/levels  simultaneously, a property which is fundamental to quantum mechanics and quantum computing. Question: What is a qubit? Answer:",
