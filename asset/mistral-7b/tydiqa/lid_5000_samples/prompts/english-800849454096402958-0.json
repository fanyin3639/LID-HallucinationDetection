    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The Siege of Orl\u00e9ans (12 October 1428 \u2013 8 May 1429) was the watershed of the Hundred Years' War between France and England. It was the French royal army's first major military victory to follow the crushing defeat at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, and also the first while Joan of Arc was with the army.[lower-alpha 2] The siege took place at the pinnacle of English power during the later stages of the war. The city held strategic and symbolic significance to both sides of the conflict. The consensus among contemporaries was that the English regent, John of Lancaster, would have succeeded in realizing his brother the English king Henry V's dream of conquering all of France if Orl\u00e9ans fell. For half a year the English and their French allies appeared to be winning but the siege collapsed nine days after Joan's arrival. Question: When was the Siege of Orleans? Answer:",
