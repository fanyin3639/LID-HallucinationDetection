    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The character of the Doctor was created by BBC Head of Drama, Sydney Newman.[16] The first format document for the programme that was to become Doctor Who \u2013 then provisionally titled The Troubleshooters \u2013 was written in March 1963 by C. E. Webber, a staff writer who had been brought in to help develop the project. Webber's document contained a main character described as \"The maturer man, 35\u201340, with some 'character twist.'\" Newman was not keen on this idea and \u2013 along with several other changes to Webber's initial format \u2013 created an alternative lead character named Dr Who, a crotchety older man piloting a stolen time machine, on the run from his own far future world.[16] No written record of Newman's conveyance of these ideas \u2013 believed to have taken place in April 1963 \u2013 exists, and the character of Dr Who first begins appearing in existing documentation from May of that year.[16] Question: Who created the Doctor Who character?
