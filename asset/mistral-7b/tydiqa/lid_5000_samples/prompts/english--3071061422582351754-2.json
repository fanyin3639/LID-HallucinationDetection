Passage: In June 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt signed into law the Food and Drug Act, also known as the \"Wiley Act\" after its chief advocate.[1] The Act prohibited, under penalty of seizure of goods, the interstate transport of food which had been \"adulterated,\" with that term referring to the addition of fillers of reduced \"quality or strength,\" coloring to conceal \"damage or inferiority,\" formulation with additives \"injurious to health,\" or the use of \"filthy, decomposed, or putrid\" substances. The act applied similar penalties to the interstate marketing of \"adulterated\" drugs, in which the \"standard of strength, quality, or purity\" of the active ingredient was not either stated clearly on the label or listed in the United States Pharmacopoeia or the National Formulary. The act also banned \"misbranding\" of food and drugs.[6] The responsibility for examining food and drugs for such \"adulteration\" or \"misbranding\" was given to Wiley's USDA Bureau of Chemistry.[1] Question: When was the FDA formed?
