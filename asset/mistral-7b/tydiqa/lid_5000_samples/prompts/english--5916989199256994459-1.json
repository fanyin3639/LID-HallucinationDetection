    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The name of Scotland is derived from the Latin Scoti, the term applied to Gaels.[2] The word Scoti (or Scotti) was first used by the Romans. It is found in Latin texts from the 4th century describing an Irish group which raided Roman Britain.[3] It came to be applied to all the Gaels. It is not believed that any Gaelic groups called themselves Scoti in ancient times, except when writing in Latin.[3] Old Irish documents use the term Scot (plural Scuit) going back as far as the 9th century, for example in the glossary of Cormac mac Cuilenn\u00e1in.[4] Question: Why is it called Scotland? Answer:",
