    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: After graduating from Abraham Lincoln High School, Sedaka and some of his classmates formed a band called the Linc-Tones. The band had minor regional hits with songs like \"While I Dream\", \"I Love My Baby\", \"Come Back, Joe\", and \"Don't Go\", before Sedaka launched his solo career and left the group in 1957. The Linc-Tones, later renamed the Tokens after Sedaka's departure, would go on to have four top-40 hits of their own without Sedaka. Sedaka's first three solo singles, \"Laura Lee\", \"Ring-a-Rockin'\", and \"Oh, Delilah!\" failed to become hits (although \"Ring-a-Rockin'\" earned him the first of many appearances on Dick Clark's American Bandstand), but they demonstrated his ability to perform as a solo singer, so RCA Victor signed him to a recording contract. Question: What was the first band Neil Sedaka was in? Answer:",
