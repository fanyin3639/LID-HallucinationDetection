    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Elemental magnesium is a gray-white lightweight metal, two-thirds the density of aluminium. It tarnishes slightly when exposed to air, although, unlike the heavier alkaline earth metals, an oxygen-free environment is unnecessary for storage because magnesium is protected by a thin layer of oxide that is fairly impermeable and difficult to remove. Magnesium has the lowest melting (923K (1,202\u00b0F)) and the lowest boiling point 1,363K (1,994\u00b0F) of all the alkaline earth metals. Question: How hot can magnesium get before melting? Answer:",
