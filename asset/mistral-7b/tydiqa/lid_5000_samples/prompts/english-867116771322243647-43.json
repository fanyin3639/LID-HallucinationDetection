    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: 45th Brigade's losses were devastating, especially in officers, and the brigade was not able to rebuild in the last few weeks of the Malayan campaign. Only 400 Indian soldiers from the 45th Brigade and 500 soldiers from the two Australian battalions escaped with Anderson's force.[33] The brigade was soon disbanded, and the remaining troops were transferred to other Indian brigades. The two Australian battalions fared little better. 271 men from the 2/19th Battalion made it to British lines, but only 130 from the 2/29th Battalion would make it back to British lines before Singapore surrendered.[2] Many men of both battalions were still in the jungle when the campaign ended.[4] According to Peter Graeme Hobbins; in 22 days of fighting (including on Singapore itself) the 2/19th Battalion suffered \"more dead, missing and wounded than any other Australian Infantry Force unit in the Second World War\", with 335 killed and 97 wounded.[34] Question: How many people died during the The Battle of Muar?
