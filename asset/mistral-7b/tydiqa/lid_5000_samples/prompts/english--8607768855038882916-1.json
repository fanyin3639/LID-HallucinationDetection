    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Old English (\u00c6nglisc, Anglisc, Englisc, pronounced[\u02c8\u00e6\u014bli\u0283]), or Anglo-Saxon,[2] is the earliest historical form of the English language, spoken in England and southern and eastern Scotland in the early Middle Ages. It was brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers probably in the mid-5th century, and the first Old English literary works date from the mid-7th century. After the Norman conquest of 1066, English was replaced, for a time, as the language of the upper classes by Anglo-Norman, a relative of French. This is regarded as marking the end of the Old English era, as during this period the English language was heavily influenced by Anglo-Norman, developing into a phase known now as Middle English. Question: What language did the Anglo-Saxons speak? Answer:",
