    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Wachovia Corporation began on June 16, 1879 in Winston-Salem, North Carolina as the Wachovia National Bank.  The bank was co-founded by James Alexander Gray and William Lemly.[9] In 1911, the bank merged with Wachovia Loan and Trust Company, \"the largest trust company between Baltimore and New Orleans\",[10] which had been founded on June 15, 1893. Wachovia grew to become one of the largest banks in the Southeast partly on the strength of its accounts from the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, which was also headquartered in Winston-Salem.[11] On December 12, 1986, Wachovia purchased First Atlanta. Founded as Atlanta National Bank on September 14, 1865, and later renamed to First National Bank of Atlanta, this institution was the oldest national bank in Atlanta. This purchase made Wachovia one of the few companies with dual headquarters: one in Winston-Salem and one in Atlanta. In 1991, Wachovia entered the South Carolina market by acquiring South Carolina National Corporation,[12] founded as the Bank of Charleston in 1834. In 1998, Wachovia acquired two Virginia-based banks, Jefferson National Bank and Central Fidelity Bank. In 1997, Wachovia acquired both 1st United Bancorp and American Bankshares Inc, giving its first entry into Florida. In 2000, Wachovia made its final purchase, which was Republic Security Bank.
