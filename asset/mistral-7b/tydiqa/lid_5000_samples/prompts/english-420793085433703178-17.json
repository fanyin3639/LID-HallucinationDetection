    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Fate/stay night was released in Japan on January 30, 2004 for Windows PCs.[6] A CERO C-rated version of Fate/stay night, titled Fate/stay night R\u00e9alta Nua, for the PlayStation 2[7] was scheduled to be released in late 2006. However, it was postponed until April 19, 2007.[8] This version provided voice acting but the sex scenes were removed due to censorship, and the target audience. The updated re-release also provided the true ending to the Fate route. Fate, Unlimited Blade Works, and Heaven's Feel are the three branching storylines found within the game. They were released separately through digital download on Windows (but as the R\u00e9alta Nua version) in the beginning of 2012. A PlayStation Vita port of R\u00e9alta Nua was released in Japan on November 29, 2012, with three new opening animations by anime studio Ufotable and the option to change the aspect ratio to 4:3, 16:9 or in-between.[9] Question: When was Fate/stay night first released as an adult game for Windows? Answer:",
