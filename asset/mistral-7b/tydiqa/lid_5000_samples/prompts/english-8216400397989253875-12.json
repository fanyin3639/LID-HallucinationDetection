    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Adult humans have roughly 20\u201330 trillion red blood cells at any given time, constituting approximately 70% of all cells by number.[18] Women have about 4\u20135 million red blood cells per microliter (cubic millimeter) of blood and men about 5\u20136 million; people living at high altitudes with low oxygen tension will have more. Red blood cells are thus much more common than the other blood particles: there are about 4,000\u201311,000 white blood cells and about 150,000\u2013400,000 platelets per microliter. Question: How many red blood cells are in the human body? Answer:",
