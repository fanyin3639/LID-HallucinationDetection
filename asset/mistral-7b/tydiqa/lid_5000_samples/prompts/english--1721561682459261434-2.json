    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Little is known of his early years, but Jacques de Molay was probably born in Molay, Haute-Sa\u00f4ne, in the County of Burgundy, at the time a territory ruled by Otto III as part of the Holy Roman Empire, and in modern times in the area of Franche-Comt\u00e9, northeastern France. His birth year is not certain, but judging by statements made during the later trials, was probably around 1250. He was born, as most Templar knights were, into a family of minor or middle-ranking nobility.[2] It is suggested that he was dubbed a knight at age 21 in 1265 and is known that he was executed in 1314, aged about 70. If correct, these dates lead to the belief that he was born about 1244. Question: Where was Jacques de Molay born? Answer:",
