    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The South Volcanic Zone (SVZ) extends roughly from Central Chile's Andes at the latitude of Santiago, at ca. 33\u00b0S,  to Cerro Arenales in Ays\u00e9n Region at ca. 46\u00b0S, a distance of well over 870mi(1,400km). The arc has formed due to subduction of the Nazca Plate under the South American Plate along the Peru\u2013Chile Trench. The northern boundary of the SVZ is marked by the flat-slab subduction of the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Ridge, which is believed to have produced a volcanic gap called the Pampean flat-slab segment in the Norte Chico region since the late Miocene. The southern end of the SVZ is marked by the Chile Triple Junction where the Chile Rise subducts under South America at the Taitao Peninsula giving origin to the Patagonian Volcanic Gap. Further south lies the Austral Volcanic Zone. Question: How long is the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes? Answer:",
