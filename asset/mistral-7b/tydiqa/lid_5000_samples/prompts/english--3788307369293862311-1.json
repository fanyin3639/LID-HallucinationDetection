    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: In 1781, during the American Revolutionary War (1775\u20131783), Maryland became the thirteenth state of the United States to ratify the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union.  They were drawn up by a committee of the Second Continental Congress (1775\u20131781), which began shortly after the adoption of a Declaration of Independence in July 1776, through to 1778. Later that year, these Articles were recommended to the newly independent sovereign states via their legislatures for the required unanimous ratification. This long process was held up for three years by objections from smaller states led by Maryland until certain issues and principles over the western lands beyond  the Appalachian Mountains to the Mississippi River. These objections were resolved with the larger states agreeing to cede their various western claims to the authority of the new Congress of the Confederation, representing all the states, to be held in common for the laying out and erection of new states out of the jointly held Federal territories. Maryland then finally agreed to join the new American confederation by being one of the last of the former colonies ratifying the long proposed Articles in 1781, when they took effect. Question: When was Maryland established? Answer:",
