Passage: After considering several actresses (including Tamannaah) for the princess role, Kajal Aggarwal was selected by Rajamouli as the female lead opposite Ram Charan after conducting a photoshoot in his office.[15] Rajamouli said that he wanted to cast her as the female lead in Yamadonga (2007) after her Telugu debut Lakshmi Kalyanam (2007), but she was unavailable. He added that he wanted somebody \"good looking, who would look like a princess and who had dates available\" and finalised her because she met all of these prerequisites.[16] After conducting her photoshoot, Rajamouli explained the story and Mithra's characterisation to her in 45 minutes. He said she needed to treat the hero arrogantly, but do so out of love for the hero. Kajal kept this in mind and acted accordingly[3] while playing the dual roles of a princess from 400 years ago and a modern-day college student. Kajal called both her roles \"unique and challenging\".[17] Question: Who plays the female lead in the film Magadheera? Answer:",
