Passage: Princess Sophie's father, a devout German Lutheran, opposed his daughter's conversion to Eastern Orthodoxy.

On the following day, the formal betrothal took place. The long-planned dynastic marriage finally occurred on 21 August 1745 in Saint Petersburg. Sophia had turned 16; her father did not travel to Russia for the wedding. The bridegroom, known then as Peter von Holstein-Gottorp, had become Duke of Holstein-Gottorp (located in the north-west of present-day Germany near the border with Denmark) in 1739. The newlyweds settled in the palace of Oranienbaum, which remained the residence of the \"young court\" for many years to come. Question: When were Peter III and Catherine the Great married?
