    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The word emaki stems from the word \"emakimono\" meaning \"picture scrolls\".  The emakimono picture scrolls consisted of two designs: Pictures that were painted on a scroll with text added to the same scroll or a number of paintings that accompanied passages of text and were joined together in a scroll. The first known picture scroll was produced in Japan during the late ninth or tenth century. The Genji Monogatari picture scroll, however, was produced in the early twelfth century.  Not only is the Genji Monogatari Emaki the oldest surviving monogatari scroll but it is also the oldest surviving non-Buddhist scroll in Japan. There is no exact date to the scroll, but it is estimated to being sometime between 1120 and 1140,[2] in which case it was created just a little over a century after Murasaki Shikibu wrote The Tale of Genji. Question: What is the oldest surviving example of calligraphy? Answer:",
