    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: Although it is generally accepted that the reticulated python is the world's longest living snake, most length estimates longer than 6.35m (20ft 10in) have been called into question.[6] It has been suggested that confident length records for the largest snakes must be established from a dead body soon after death, or alternatively from a heavily sedated snake, using a steel tape and in the presence of witnesses, and must be published (and preferably recorded on video).[6] At least one reticulated python was measured under full anesthesia at 6.95m (22ft 10in), and somewhat less reliable scientific reports up to 10m (33ft) have appeared.[8] Question: What is the longest snake in the world?
