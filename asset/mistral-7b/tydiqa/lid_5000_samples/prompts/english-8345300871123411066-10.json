    "Answer the following questions:\nAnswer the following question based on the information in the given passage. Passage: The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for iodine in 2000. For people age 14 and up, the iodine RDA is 150 \u03bcg/day; the RDA for pregnant women is 220 \u03bcg/day and the RDA during lactation is 290 \u03bcg/day. For children 1\u20138 years, the RDA is 90 \u03bcg/day; for children 8\u201313 years, 130 \u03bcg/day.[16] As a safety consideration, the IOM sets tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. The UL for iodine for adults is 1,100\u03bcg/day. This UL was assessed by analyzing the effect of supplementation on thyroid-stimulating hormone.[5] Collectively, the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs).[16] Question: What is the recommended amount of iodine for humans? Answer:",
