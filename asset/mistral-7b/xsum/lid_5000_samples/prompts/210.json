        "German politicians want Europe to set up a database to keep track of leftist militants, following clashes that left nearly 500 police officers injured during the G20 summit in Hamburg."

    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nThere is a heated debate now about the police tactics, as some 6,000 Hamburg residents clean up after the riots.\nSome in Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrat (CDU) party say Hamburg Mayor Olaf Scholz should quit.\nLeft-wing extremists of the so-called Black Bloc are under intense scrutiny.\nGermany has had previous experience in tackling the violent protesters who try to disrupt international summits.\nThe Hamburg authorities deployed about 20,000 police to keep protesters away from the G20 venue.\nMr Scholz and his Social Democrat (SPD) allies argue that the police did their main job effectively - protecting the G20.\nBut a minority of anti-G20 protesters - more or less affiliated to the Black Bloc - engaged in running battles with police in the streets.\nViolence was predictable after the leftist militants invited in sympathisers from across Europe with the slogan \"Welcome to Hell\".\nThe flashpoint was an authorised demonstration by about 12,000 people on Thursday evening. Violence erupted when police tried to isolate Black Bloc militants who refused to remove their masks, defying the law.\nPolice had earlier banned an overnight protest camp in the city - yet the right to peaceful assembly is enshrined in German law.\nCornered by police, the violent minority, numbering about 1,000 and clad in black, hurled bottles and chunks of paving stone. Some protesters scaled a wall and rained fireworks down on the police.\nOfficers in full riot gear retaliated with baton charges, tear gas and water cannon. An anti-terrorist unit was called in to help disperse the Black Bloc. There were 186 arrests.\nThe worst of the violence gripped the central Schanzen district. It is an area famous for its left-wing \"alternative\" scene, including squatters at the Rote Flora cultural centre.\nClashes continued throughout the G20 summit - until Sunday morning. Some shops were vandalised and looted - including a supermarket - and several cars set ablaze.\nRead more on the G20:\nMemorable moments from the G20\nG20 talks fail to bridge climate chasm\nIvanka Trump takes father's seat at G20\nWho are the G20 protesters?\nThe most eye-catching proposal is to launch a European database to monitor violent leftists and prevent them crossing borders when summits such as the G20 are getting under way.\nA senior CDU politician, Thomas Strobl, called for a database to identify \"marauding, travelling, violent left-wing extremists\".  But he admitted that police could only arrest \"those who we know are up to no good\".\nGreen Party leader Simone Peter warned against a \"populist, knee-jerk\" reaction. She pointed to the EU's existing intelligence database - the Schengen Information System (SIS) - and said police forces ought to use it more efficiently.\nSome of Mrs Merkel's conservative allies accuse the SPD, Greens and left-wing Die Linke of turning a blind eye to far-left extremists.\nBut Die Linke has called for a parliamentary inquiry into the G20 violence.\nFor a long time the authorities' focus has been on Islamist violence and neo-Nazi extremists. Intelligence on those extremists is shared via an EU database, but sometimes police co-operation is patchy.\nMrs Merkel's chief of staff, Peter Altmaier, has defended the Hamburg mayor, saying police tactics were agreed between the city and the federal government.\nThe government has offered compensation to businesses that were vandalised - a process that could take many weeks.\nThe police are struggling to identify instigators of the violence.
