There may well have been opportunities to see what this guy was doing - looks like he's been quite clever in the way he's done it, he's done it over a period of time.\"\nHowever, he added: \"There'll definitely be an inquiry, systems will be looked at and challenged and things will be tightened and hardened up, I don't think there's any doubt about that.\"\nMaj Gen Cross, who served in Northern Ireland, said security questions put to soldiers in the past are no longer asked due to \"political correctness\".\n\"I was vetted, from a security point of view, regularly, throughout my 40-odd years in the military,\" he said.\n\"What's interesting today is that a lot of the sort of questions that I used to be asked 20, 30 years ago, putting it most bluntly, are now politically incorrect, people are not prepared to ask them.\n\"So the security vetting process, I think, is a lot more difficult because of, inverted commas, political correctness.\"\nCounty Antrim man Maxwell was based with 40 Commando in Somerset.\nAccording to the charge details, he had a stash of explosives in purpose-built hides in England and Northern Ireland.\nLast March, police said bomb-making parts had been found in barrels hidden in a wooded area in Carnfunnock County Park in County Antrim.\nTwo months later another \"terrorist hide\" was found in Capanagh Forest, also near Larne.\nPolice described it as one of the most significant arms finds in recent years.\nOf particular concern to security chiefs was the discovery of military grade anti-personnel mines.\nTheir serial numbers revealed they had been taken from the Royal Marines base in Somerset where Maxwell was based.\nCourt papers revealed that 12 hides were discovered in total.\nMaj Gen Cross said the most concerning aspect of Maxwell's case was how he was able to steal military weapons.\n\"The reality of getting this stuff in and out of an armoury, that is a seriously important process, normally ridden with checks and something clearly went wrong in this case,\" he said.\nIn a statement, the MoD said: \"We are aware that a member of the armed forces has pleaded guilty to terrorism offences and we will consider the implications very carefully.\n\"We will continue to fully co-operate with legal proceedings and, with these ongoing, it would be inappropriate to comment further.\"\nSummary:\n",
