You think they will do.\n\"The question is whether an enemy contemplating aggression would be prepared to take the risk.\"\n\u00a331bn\nIn case costs overrun, the government will also set aside \u00a310bn\nPrevious estimates put the cost at up to \u00a325bn\nA Ministry of Defence spokesman said: \"We wouldn't comment on the detail of our security arrangements for the nuclear deterrent but we can and will safeguard it from any cyber threat.\n\"We are investing more than ever before on the UK's defensive and offensive cyber capabilities to protect our national interests.\n\"Last week the Chancellor outlined a plan for \u00a31.9bn in cyber investment, including a \u00a3165m Defence and Cyber Innovation Fund, to support innovative procurement across both defence and cyber security.\"\nIn the Commons on Monday, Prime Minister David Cameron confirmed MPs would get a non-binding vote on whether to renew the four submarines carrying the UK's nuclear missiles.\nOfficial Labour policy remains to renew Trident, but party leader Jeremy Corbyn is firmly opposed and a review is taking place to consider the party's stance.\nBy Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor\nLord Browne's comments may be seized on by supporters of Jeremy Corbyn, who are trying to persuade the Labour Party to abandon its support for the deterrent.\nThe party's leadership is urging its MPs to abstain in a vote later, called by the SNP, that seeks to reject the renewal of Trident.\nThe vote will not be binding, but Britain's nuclear deterrent is an increasingly expensive, and politically troublesome issue.\nRead more from Laura\nLabour MPs are being asked to abstain in the vote - but as many as 20 are thought to be prepared to rebel and vote for Trident to be renewed.\nFollowing a meeting of the party's MPs at Westminster on Monday night, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the debate was an \"SNP stunt\".\nThe SNP has criticised the \"ballooning\" cost of Trident, saying the Commons vote could be \"the last parliamentary chance to stop this utterly awful project\".\nSpeaking during the SDSR debate, Angus Robertson, the SNP's Westminster leader, said it was a \"super-expensive vanity project\" which had failed to deter \"against terrorism or cyber attack or conventional attacks on the UK and its allies and friends\".\nThe defence review committed the government to a debate on the future of Trident, describing renewing the system as a \"national endeavour\".\nIt did not commit the government to a vote on the main renewal decision, however, during the Commons debate, Mr Cameron said he was \"keen\" to hold a vote \"at the appropriate moment\".\nThe review said the revised cost - including a \u00a310bn contingency - and timescale of the project reflected the \"greater understanding we now have about the detailed design of the submarines and their manufacture\".\nIt also pledged \u00a31.9bn over the next five years to protect the UK from cyber attacks.\nOther measures in the government's \u00a3178bn defence spending plans for the next decade included:\nSummary:\n",
