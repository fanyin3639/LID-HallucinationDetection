    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nWigan went ahead through Joel Tomkins' try before Luke Walsh replied in an intense first half that ended 6-6.\nGeorge Williams scored a fantastic solo try for Wigan, but Adam Swift danced in to reduce the deficit to two points.\nJon Wilkin's high kick was collected by Jones three minutes from time to seal St Helens' comeback.\nSaints' Jordan Turner was denied a 100th career try after an obstruction earlier in the play, and the visitors took full advantage.\nA great piece of skill from Matty Smith set up Tomkins for his first try since June as he waltzed in under the posts, with Matty Bowen adding the extras.\nSt Helens hit back when a clever dummy by Walsh saw him sneak in and just ground the ball for his seventh try of the season. He converted to level the scores.\nBowen's 20-metre penalty edged Wigan in front five minutes after the break, before Williams dummied his way through three tackles to run 40 metres and go over. Bowen's kick stretched Wigan's lead.\nAfter Wigan's Joe Burgess had a try disallowed for a knock-on, St Helens broke quickly, Swift jinking his way into the left-hand corner and Walsh's conversion closing the gap to two points.\nWith the clock ticking down, Jones's leap over the line secured a dramatic victory for the hosts three minutes from time.\nSt Helens coach Keiron Cunningham:\n\"The boys played really well. They've had a lot of stuff said about them in the last few weeks and it wasn't very nice about certain individuals. Let's see what they say this week.\n\"We weren't that great with the ball but we defended like troopers, we just kept hanging in there and finding a way to keep turning up.\n\"It's that team spirit you can't manufacture, you've got to have that fight and that will. It makes it special when you see players fighting for each other.\"\nWigan coach Shaun Wane:\n\"That's hurt me badly, very badly. It will take me a few days to get over this. Unless you concentrate for 80 minutes, you can get burned. That's rugby league. It's a tough sport.\n\"We controlled the game for large parts but it shows the quality they have. They never go away. I never felt comfortable.\n\"It was a great game to watch I'd imagine. I'm very proud of the effort of my players but to come away with nothing after doing as much as they did is an absolute heartbreaker.\"\nSt Helens: Quinlan; Makinson, Percival, Jones, Swift; Turner, Walsh; Amor, Roby, Savelio, McCarthy-Scarsbrook, Greenwood, Wilkin.\nReplacements: Masoe, Vea, Flanagan, Richards.\nWigan Warriors: Bowen; Charnley, Bateman, Gildart, Burgess; Williams, Smith; Crosby, McIlorum, Flower, Tomkins, Patrick, O'Loughlin.\nReplacements: Gelling, Powell, Clubb, Mossop.\nReferee: Robert Hicks,\nSummary:\n",
