    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\n\"It made me more determined and more stubborn. Possibly, that is why I've ended up where I am today,\" the Para-canoeist told BBC East Midlands Today earlier this year.\nThat stubbornness has taken Wiggs to Rio 2016, ready to try and convert four years of winning into a Paralympic gold medal when Para-canoeing makes its debut at the Games on Wednesday.\nWiggs, 36, was 18 years old and on a gap year in Australia when she became ill. It changed her life forever.\n\"I was chasing and shearing sheep and working on a farm,\" said Harrow-born Wiggs. \"About six weeks in I contracted a virus; we still don't know where from, but it basically left me paralysed in my arms and legs overnight\n\"I'm lucky that my arms recovered, but my legs didn't. I didn't want it to influence my future and what I wanted to achieve, my hopes and aspirations.\"\nWiggs went on to become a PE teacher and, after being discovered at a British talent day, captained GB's sitting volleyball team to a bronze medal at the world championships and then competed at London 2012.\nShe immediately set out to find a new challenge and, five months after sitting in a canoe for the first time, she was 2013 Para-canoe K1 sprint world champion.\nAnd then 2014 world champion. And then 2015. And 2016. She was also 2014 world champion in the Va'a class.\nOh, and add a world record in there too.\nOn Wednesday she races in the K1 KL2 class 200m heats (13:20 BST) and, all being well, the semi-finals (14:22 BST), before Thursday's final (13:16 BST).\n\"Right. The time has come. Three and a half years of hard work on the water and in the gym,\" she wrote in a Twitter post this week.\n\"It's been an incredible few years. I've done everything I possibly could to be the best I could be and that has got me here.\"\nSummary:\n",
