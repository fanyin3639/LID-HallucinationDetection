The very term robot was less than 20 years old, having been coined by Czech writer Karel Capek in his 1920 play RUR.\nThe first British robot is believed to have been constructed in 1928 and was called Eric.

Lawson, once an electric tramway employee. The robot has a sound apparatus in its head.\n\"Every move of the robot is followed, chiefly by the crowd of young folk, especially when he is on point duty.\"\nMr Lawson tried to capitalise on Robert's fame, exhibiting him around the country. His son said he eventually sold him to a pier showman in Blackpool shortly before the start of World War Two.\nDespite several attempts to trace him, Robert's whereabouts remain unknown. But it seems possible he enjoyed a post-war career as a seaside attraction before disappearing into obscurity.\nTony Sharkey, head of local history at Blackpool library, said robots often appeared in sideshows during the 1950s, including one from South Africa called Magna.\n\"From images I've seen it appears to have been very different [to Robert]. The show included illusions and the robot would mind read and tell people what they were wearing.\"\nMr Lawson sold his shop in the 1960s and retired, but although he was \"quiet man\" he would talk to people about his robots if asked.\nHe died in 2002 in Kettering, aged 96.\n\"It is only recently when I've thought about the complexity of the robot that I realised how clever he was,\" his son said.\nSummary:\n",
