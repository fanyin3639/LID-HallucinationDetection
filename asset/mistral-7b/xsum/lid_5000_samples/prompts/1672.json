We went away from what we know best and were all over the place at times,\" said the Wolverhampton Wanderers player.\n\"Going 1-0 up so early we should have put the game to bed, if anything we were holding on at the end.\n\"We are massively disappointed. In the first half we played reasonably well, created lots of chances but after they got the goal back we were very poor.\n\"That is down to the players and it is definitely two points dropped.\"\nManager Chris Coleman shared his player's disappointment, and admitted Wales were happy to hang for a draw in a nervous finish.\n\"I think people are looking at it as two points dropped but it might have been two points gained at the end of the day,\" he said.\n\"We had a great goal, a great start, but then we got too comfortable you know.\n\"The whole atmosphere was too comfortable on the pitch. In games like that you've got to take care of business, and we didn't and we were punished.\n\"We are disappointed. The two games in four days is tough, not easy, but it is what it is and we have to get on with it. Once we got the goal we had to take care of the job and we didn't do that.\n\"We could have lost it in the second half.\n\"Against Georgia at home, you have got to take three points but it means the next game against Serbia here there is more pressure to get three points.\n\"We have to deal with that.\"\nWales dropped to third-place in Pool D after Republic of Ireland beat Moldova 3-1 and Serbia emerged 3-2 winners against Austria.\nSummary:\n",
