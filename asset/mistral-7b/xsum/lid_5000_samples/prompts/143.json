    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nThe hosts' display was uncertain and their opponents took full advantage when Jegveni Harin volleyed home.\nBut Hearts swiftly levelled, Prince Buaben converting  a penalty after Vladimir Avilov handled in the box.\nThey went ahead via an Andrei Kalimullin own goal before half-time, but Infonet spurned chances to level.\nThe victory was accompanied by a clear sense of relief for Robbie Neilson and his players.\nInfonet are midway through their league campaign and in second place. They looked organised and athletic, so the victory provides Hearts with an important advantage.\nRaggedness dogged the home side throughout and there was never any sense of them being in command.\nThey set out to build on their lead in the second half, but struggled to play through a stubborn Infonet defence, while the visitors continued to threaten on the attack.\nJack Hamilton had to make a series of second-half saves, but also watch in relief as Harin's driven shot from the edge of the box, having skipped inside from the right flank, was deflected onto the roof of the net.\nHarin was one of several Infonet players to cause problems for the Hearts defence.\nThey were enthused by his opening goal, but also by the agility of towering centre-forward Vladimir Voskoboinikov and the energy of Dmitrij Kruglov, who drew a superb diving save from Hamilton in the first half and another late on with a 40-yard free-kick.\nHearts had to overcome periods of alarm, but familiar traits were at least to hand.\nSam Nicholson was bright, inventive and full of dangerous running, while Faycal Rherras, too, looked athletic and technically composed on his debut at left-back.\nHaving conceded the opening goal, Hearts refused to buckle. There was an element of good fortune to the equaliser, with the penalty awarded for handball, but the link-up play between another debutant, Conor Sammon, and Juama was sharp in the build-up. Buaben was composed with his spot-kick.\nThe goal signalled a spell of pressure as Hearts began to find their rhythm and when Jamie Walker slung a corner towards the back post, Paterson turned the ball back across goal, where Kalimullin awkwardly turned it into his own net.\nUncertain, and occasionally last-gasp, defending was a feature of Hearts' play, although Hamilton remained assured in goal.\nStill short of match sharpness and dynamism, the second leg - a 1645 BST kick-off in Tallinn next Wednesday - is unlikely to be a formality.\nSummary:\n",
