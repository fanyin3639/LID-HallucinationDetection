    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\n\"When I first came here, I used to be scared to go out, always looking around in case the police caught me.  I lived in constant fear.\"\nQui's story of being an illegal immigrant will be familiar to millions all over Europe.  But he has come to a country that is hardly known as a magnet for migrants - Poland.\nHe is from Vietnam and part of one of Poland's biggest ethnic minorities.  (The link began when both countries had communism in common.)\nQui works in the clothes trade in Warsaw.  And these days, he has his own market stall, a family, an apartment in a concrete high-rise block on the outskirts of Warsaw\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and peace of mind.\nHe is legal, having benefitted from an amnesty organised, earlier this year, by a government newly-aware that its economy needs people like him.\nHe says it feels like a huge weight has been lifted off his shoulders.\nQui and his wife Thiem met in Poland and they are proud of their new status and of their host country.\n\"Our son has a Polish name\", they say, \"because we live in Poland, we love Poland and we feel tied to it\".  They talk of his future university education there.\nVenture a kilometre or two outside the historic centre of Warsaw and you do not have to look very hard to see how profoundly the capital is changing.\nBakalarska Market is a vast clothes, electrical and food retail centre run almost exclusively by non-Poles.\nMusic and voices from Vietnam, Bulgaria, Turkey, Nigeria, China, Ukraine and Belarus are proof of a nascent ethnic mix that would have been unimaginable until recently.\nIn the last two years, the number of applications for work permits in Poland has doubled.\nEurostat figures show only 0.1% of people in Poland were born abroad, the lowest figure in the European Union.\nBefore World War II, a quarter of Poland's population was Jewish, German or Ukrainian.  But by 1947, virtually all those people had either been murdered or banished.\nStripped of their sovereignty as part of the Soviet bloc, Poles were left with their blood ties and their Catholicism to give them a sense of nationhood.  And communism - as well as an entirely understandable persecution complex - helped keep the country in a kind of ethnic isolation.\nBut a long list of factors suggests the country's monoculture could soon be a thing of the past.\nAs most of Europe slows, economically, Poland picks up.  It was the only EU member of 27 to avoid recession during the crisis of 2008-2009 and it continues to buck trends.\nListen to the full report on BBC Radio 4's Crossing Continents on Thursday, 20 Dec at 11:00 GMT and Monday, 24 Dec at 20:30 GMT\nListen via the Radio 4 website\nDownload the programme\nExplore the best of Crossing Continents\nAt the same time, it has labour shortages exacerbated by the emigration of millions of workers.\nThe man in charge of immigration policy, Rafal Rogala, seems well aware there are changes in store.\n\"I feel proud\", says the Minister for Foreigners, \"that Poland is a destination country for economic migrants.  We understand them perfectly because, up until now, we have been the economic migrants.\n\"Buried deep within us is this gene of openness toward foreigners.  We understand the need to improve your fate and build a life elsewhere.  Now it is a question of education, of getting our people used to the idea that we are a destination country for lots of foreigners who will want to live and work here\".\nMr Rogala admits that immigration might not be a matter of choice, given the economic circumstances.\nHe has reservations shared by western European politicians whose countries have already lived through an influx.  And the British model is not one he is keen to copy.\nIn no way is he suggesting, he says, \"that we want to become a multicultural society.
