None of us have a clue how we're going to cope without her.\"\nThey described Ms Jones, who worked at Highfields Nursing Home, as \"always willing to help others\".\n\"She'll be missed by so many people,\" they said in the statement, issued via Gwent Police.\n\"She loved everyone around her including all of the people she cared for at work.\n\"We are all devastated and would appreciate if everyone can respect our privacy.\"\nColin Thomas, who has a brother in the care home where Ms Jones worked, said people remained in a state of shock over her death.\n\"She couldn't do enough for the inpatients up there,\" he said.\n\"She was just adorable.

You can't thank them enough.\"\nMr Randell and Ms Nicklin, who live in Warrington, Cheshire, said it made them feel sick to think someone had been \"watching and waiting to attack\" while they were on the beach.\nMs Nicklin said: \"I genuinely believed we were going to die.
