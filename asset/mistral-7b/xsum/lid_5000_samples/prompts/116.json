    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nIt follows claims that her mobile phone and millions of French calls have been monitored by the US National Security Agency (NSA).\nMrs Merkel said once seeds of mistrust had been sown, it made co-operation on intelligence more difficult.\nThe row over alleged spying continues to overshadow an EU summit in Brussels.\nOn Thursday, the UK's Guardian newspaper reported that it had obtained a confidential memo from the NSA suggesting it had monitored the phones of 35 world leaders.\nSpeaking at the end of the first day of the talks on Thursday, Mrs Merkel said France and Germany wanted to \"create a framework\" with the US on surveillance.\nShe stressed that she wanted to look for a basis to move forward with Washington, and that she was looking for deeds, not just apologetic words.\n\"It's become clear that for the future, something must change - and significantly,\" Mrs Merkel said.\n\"We will put all efforts into forging a joint understanding by the end of the year for the co-operation of the (intelligence) agencies between Germany and the US, and France and the US, to create a framework for the co-operation.\"\nAt a separate news conference, President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy said EU leaders \"took note of the intention of France and Germany to seek bilateral talks with the US\".\nOther countries would be \"free to join this initiative,\" he said.\nMr Van Rompuy said intelligence-gathering was a vital weapon against terrorism but it would be prejudiced by \"a lack of trust\".\nOther leaders expressed anger at the spying allegations.\nSwedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt said it was \"completely unacceptable\" to eavesdrop on the leader of an ally, a view echoed by Italian PM Enrico Letta, who added: \"We want the truth.\"\nMrs Merkel has demanded a \"complete explanation\" of the phone-tapping claims, which emerged in the German media.\nBut the BBC's Chris Morris in Brussels says that, despite the widespread anger about American spying, Mrs Merkel opposed a suggestion to suspend trade talks with the United States - and on that point, the UK will be relieved.\nMrs Merkel had raised her concerns with US President Barack Obama in a call on Wednesday.\nWhite House spokesman Jay Carney later said Mr Obama had assured Mrs Merkel that her phone was not being listened to now and would not be in the future.\nHowever, his statement left open the question of whether calls had been listened to in the past.\nFrench President Francois Hollande has also expressed alarm at reports that French phone calls had been monitored.\nItaly's weekly L'Espresso has reported that the US and UK have been spying on Italian internet and phone traffic.\nThe revelations were sourced to US whistleblower Edward Snowden.

The numbers were reportedly supplied by a US government official.\nNone of the leaders was named, but the memo said \"little reportable intelligence'' was obtained.\nIn another development, two Western diplomats have revealed that US officials briefed them on documents obtained by Edward Snowden that could detail intelligence co-operation between their countries, the AP news agency reported.\nThe Washington Post earlier reported that some intelligence operations revealed in the documents involve countries not publicly allied to the US.\nThe Post said that in some cases, one part of the co-operating government may know about the collaboration while others - such as the foreign ministry - may not.\nThe EU leaders are now arriving for Friday's summit talks.\nThey are scheduled to discuss the dilemma posed by migration, which has been brought into sharp focus by the deaths of hundreds of people who have drowned trying to cross the Mediterranean in recent weeks.\nMaria Nicolini, the mayor of Lampedusa, the Italian island where many of the bodies have been brought ashore, was in Brussels on Thursday.
