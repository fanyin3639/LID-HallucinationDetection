    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nIf forecasts are correct, the gap in productivity between Wales and the UK will widen, analysis from the Bevan Foundation suggests.\nIt predicts more professional but fewer lower skilled jobs, which make up a significant part of Wales' economy.\nBut the Wales Office said wages and living standards are both improving.\nThe foundation urges radical approaches.\nThe Merthyr Tydfil-based think-tank has brought together economic, education, environment and health forecasts.\nIt gives three scenarios and if the current forecasts are correct, the outlook for Wales in five years is \"far from rosy\".\nThe foundation said the Welsh government and public bodies need to re-think how they do things to tackle the challenge to living standards.\nThe UK government said Wales has the joint fastest growing economy in the UK.\nA Welsh government spokesman said: \"We will consider the issues raised in this report but let's be clear, we are a pro-business government.\n\"We work very closely with companies to create growth and jobs in every part of Wales. Inward investment is at its highest for decades because investors know that they can rely on a supportive, agile government and a skilled workforce.\"\n\"It is highly unlikely that the approaches of the last 15 years will manage to buck the trend in the next five,\" said foundation director and report author Dr Victoria Winckler.\n\"We need to ask some searching and fundamental questions about the role of the state, third sector and business; about how to target scarce resources and how to engage with people.\n\"These are probably the biggest challenges to face Wales in a generation. They are tough individually but, like buses, they're all coming at once.\"\nThe report calls for Wales to make use of its environment, history and culture, businesses and institutions and \"crucially, the skills and resilience of its people\".\nWHAT WALES COULD LOOK LIKE\nThe report said business as usual was not an option and Wales needs to anticipate the future and not just react to the present.\nDr Martin Rhisiart, an economist at the University of South Wales, said it was an interesting and commendable report but there were many uncertainties with economic forecasts.\nHe said there was a need for more openness when debating the long-term challenges.\n\"At times we are lacking some self-critique in Wales. We don't have much independence of thought, the state has a disproportionate role in the lives of individuals, we don't have as big a private sector, so very few independent institutions are doing or are commissioning research around the themes of this report.\n\"That would lead to diversity and alternative ideas.\"\nThe Wales Office said Wales was an ambitious nation with a strong future built on solid economic foundations.\n\"Notwithstanding the fact that many of the issues touched upon in this report are the responsibility of the Welsh government, it completely ignores the dramatic transformation that the Welsh economy has experienced over the last five years,\" said a spokesman.\nSummary:\n",
