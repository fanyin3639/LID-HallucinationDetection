    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nThe government is promising help in the Budget, but critics are calling the rates system itself \"unfit for purpose in the 21st century\".\nAs the commercial rental value of business premises are brought up to date, there will inevitably be some big losers. (You can learn more about the process here.)\nTo get a snapshot 'rate reaction', we asked six shopkeepers we have previously profiled for our My Shop video series to reveal how they will be affected in April. Some are angry, some pleasantly surprised - and one thinks he knows a better way.\n\"Trying to find the extra cash is going to be close to impossible,\" complains Mike Wells.\nHis shop Uptomen in Leigh-on-Sea is devoted to male products, from shaving foam to belt buckles. Surprisingly, it attracts a mainly female clientele, looking for gifts for the men in their lives.\nHe is one of the unlucky shopkeepers who will pay more when new business rates kick in. \u00a31,000 more a year to be exact.\nThis is because the 'rateable value' of his shop, which he runs alone, has gone up \u00a32,000 to \u00a317,250.\n\"My own personal wage is way below minimum wage,\" he explains, \"and has been at the same level for almost five years, just \u00a34 per hour. How will I survive?\"\n\"Landlords are generally a greedy bunch and whilst they are happy to raise rents when times are good, they (in my experience) never reduce them when times are hard.\"\n\"A tax based on a business's ability to pay would be much fairer\u2026Oh yes, one of those already exists. Corporation tax.\"\nSpare a thought for tea-importer Andrews Gadsden in Portsmouth.\nHe made a Brexit bonus by stocking up on lots of tea in dollars before the referendum - but much of those savings will now be needed to pay his rates bill.\nHe is looking at a 44% rise, as the rateable value of his warehouse-cum-cafe goes up from \u00a318,997 to \u00a327,346.\n\"To stand still I must sell \u00a320,000 more tea or reduce staffing - that's the reality,\" he says.\nThe high value of his large premises means that he has never qualified for any relief - which the government offers to small businesses in lower property bands.\n\"Effectively this [rate rise] will come out of my pocket, a pay cut for me.\"\n\"Mrs May says 'Britain is open for business'. Well the pips are squeaking.\"\nNot all our shopkeepers are losing out.\nWhen he turned 50, Steve Everitt decided to follow his dream and build a Phil Silvers-themed memorabilia shop in Coventry.\nIn his first year of business, 2015, he was based in an old shipping container in the FarGo Village mall. He did all his paperwork and was pleased to find his crate generated zero rates.\nHowever, when he graduated to a more conventional retail space in the mall last year he had to pay \u00a3565. It would have been free but retail relief was abolished that year, he recalls sadly.\nThe latest revaluation has returned his rates to zero for 2017.\nIn the new system business properties rated at up to \u00a312,000 pay zero rates (the threshold used to be \u00a36,000).\nIt's good news for a shop that runs on passion and niche marketing.\nClothes maker Carin Mansfield also benefits from the threshold change.\nShe makes 'new vintage', hand-made clothes that are expensive, but she says will last for 50 years - long enough to survive around seven business rate revaluations.\nHer small shop IN-KU is near Warren Street in central London - but it's tiny and actually doesn't get a huge amount of footfall.\nWhen it was rated back in 2010, her value was set at \u00a36,500. She paid around \u00a350 per month to Camden Council, she says.\nHer new rateable value is \u00a39,000. Despite the rise, she now doesn't have to pay anything.\n\"I am not sure if it is fair to use the square footage as a calculation [for business rates],\" she says.\n\"IN-KU has very small square footage, but it works for my purpose.\"\nZiferblat is a small franchise of \"pay per minute\" cafes that are thriving since expanding outside of London, where commercial rents are cheaper.\nIn these innovative cafes, you can consume as much food, drink and wi-fi as you like - on the clock.\n\"The effect on us is neutral,\" explains owner Colin Shenton.\n\"Our rates in Manchester rise by 15%, in Liverpool it stays the same and in Leeds it drops by a third.\"\nHaving a geographical spread has protected them, as commercial property prices vary across the country.\n\"It must be fair that a small retailer in a market town pays less than a multinational on Bond Street,\" says Mr Shenton.\n\"Retailers should not complain,\" he reckons. \"In theory, higher rents should mean higher turnover from their more desirable location.\"\nWhat really matters is the multiplier that local councils apply to the valuations, he adds.\nJon Sharkey's music t-shirt business in Liverpool's St. Quiggins centre is barely big enough to park a van in - in fact it doesn't even have solid walls.\nHe's chuffed that he's been nominated for 'Best New Business' at this year's Liverpool Retail Awards - alongside well-known names such as Victoria's Secret.\nThough business-savvy, he is not entirely sure how his business rates have changed.
