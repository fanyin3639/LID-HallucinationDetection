Psychologically, yeah, it's good. Feels great. I'm happy.\"\nHamilton said: \"I just generally didn't have the pace today. Nico did a great job and I don't think I had the balance quite where I like it - tomorrow there is still a lot to play for.\"\nAt the back, Englishman Will Stevens again out-qualified his Spanish team-mate Roberto Merhi by 0.838secs.\nAlonso's success over the years has transformed Spain's interest in F1 and this race is usually packed with fans as a result, but on Saturday it was the country's latest grand prix driver who grabbed the headlines.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSainz's fifth place was the best performance of his career, and he said that he had not found it difficult to focus despite the extra attention on him this weekend.\n\"You have a lot more interviews, a  lot more photos to take in the paddock, a lot more events and press conferences,\" he said, \"but to be honest I did not realise I was in Spain until the Q3 in lap and suddenly I came out of my qualifying bubble and looked around and saw all the crowd cheering.\n\"I said: 'This must be for me.'
