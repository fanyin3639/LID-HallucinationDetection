    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nA report commissioned by the Humanist Society of Scotland (HSS) said the position of religion had weakened in most areas of life in recent years.\nBut it said laws protecting religion in education had, if anything, been strengthened.\nA Church of Scotland spokesman said religious groups from all faiths made appropriate contributions to education.\nThe 355-page HSS report, written by academics at Glasgow University, cited the growth of Sunday trading and the rise in popularity of non-religious marriages as evidence Scotland was becoming a more secular society.\nHSS chief executive Gordon MacRae said: \"The motivation for this commission came from the increased public and political awareness of the changing role of religion and belief in Scottish public life.\"\nHe added: \"At a time when 47%, nearly one in two households in Scotland, say they have no religion, we think it is time to move to a secular education system.\n\"Every state school in Scotland is a faith school. We hope this document can be a catalyst for a new debate.\"\nThe report said the current education system was established by two Acts of Parliament in 1872 and 1918, when Catholic schools were absorbed into the state system.\nAll state schools are required to ensure all pupils take part in 'religious observance' - at least once a week for primary pupils and at least once a month for secondary schools.\nThese provisions were reinforced in 2004 by the Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition, and accepted in a government circular in 2011 under the SNP.\nThe report outlines other areas in which the position of religion is guaranteed by law in the education system:\nOne of the report's authors, Callum Brown, professor of Modern European History at Glasgow University, said: \"There is no particular move at foot to change this, in comparison to changes, dramatic changes to marriage law, with the arrival of same-sex marriage in 2014.\n\"That was a phenomenal and ground-breaking change which doesn't seem to have an equivalent in relation to education.\"\nThe HSS said the growth of Sunday trading in recent years and the failure of Sabbatarian groups to prevent the development of ferry and air services to Presbyterian strongholds such as the Western Isles had also shown the weakening of the position of religion in Scottish life.\nBut Prof Jane Mair, of Glasgow University Law School, another co-author of the report, said laws concerning religion in schools had not shifted.\nShe said: \"Although the idea of religious education focuses to a great extent on the idea of custom, we haven't gone back to look at the changing custom in society.\n\"There is still an expectation that people want a particular type of religious education, but perhaps we haven't, a society, really reviewed how that has changed.\"\nThe Very Rev John Chalmers, principal clerk to the Church of Scotland General Assembly, agreed there had been a decline in religious influence in society.\nBut he said it was not true to say the influence of religious groups in education was being strengthened.\nHe told BBC Scotland: \"It was, after all, the church which put education in place, in every parish in Scotland.\n\"The influence couldn't have been greater in those days. Now the church is invited to participate where appropriate to participate in religious reflection in schools.\n\"It doesn't force that down anybody's throat. It is there, if invited, and it's there to contribute alongside other faiths and others from the ecumenical spectrum.\"\nSummary:\n",
