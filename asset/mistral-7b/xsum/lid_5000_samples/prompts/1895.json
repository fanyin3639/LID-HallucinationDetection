That's why there are six-and-a-half million people displaced.\"\nHe added: \"What should our reaction be to this carnage in this country? We need to be the voice of clarity, of sanity and of humanity.\n\"We have to have the clarity to put forward the vision that adding a few more ageing Tornado sorties will have no military consequences whatsoever but it will add to human suffering.\n\"We have to have the clarity to say we have a Prime Minister who is still smarting from being turned over in military action two years ago when he wanted to target Assad and is itching to reverse a Commons vote on military action.\"\nAnd to cheers from the conference floor, Mr Salmond said: \"There should be no more futile military interventions by the UK.\n\"No more Afghanistans with no exit strategies, no more Libyas where we spent 13 times as much bombing as we did reconstructing that country and no more illegal wars such as the one in Iraq.\n\"Above all, the path we should tread is that of humanity.\"\nSummary:\n",
