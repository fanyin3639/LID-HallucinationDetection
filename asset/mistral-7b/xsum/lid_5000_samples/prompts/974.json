    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nLike most Germans, the businessman pays into compulsory health insurance.\nHe contributes 7% of his salary before tax and his employers match that amount.\nIn return, patients get access to care which is so rapid that national waiting data is not collected.\n\"The doctor said to me that I have to decide when I get the operation. Normally it takes three or four weeks.\"\nGeorg travels for work to the UK and tells me he was astonished to hear that patients can sometimes wait months for a similar routine operation.\nGermany's spending on health care is relatively high, just over 11% of its wealth, compared to 9.8% in the UK and it has more doctors and hospital beds per patient than the UK.\nGeorg's operation was carried out in an 80-bed hospital in one of the Black Forest towns in the south-west region Baden Wurttemberg.\nBut even in Germany's well-funded system, the financial viability of a hospital this small is not guaranteed.\nA group of doctors in this area is trying to manage costs in an experiment that has attracted interest from the UK.\nMartin Wetzel, a GP for 25 years, explains they have done a deal with big insurance funds to make prevention a priority.\n\"I have more time - and it needs more time to explain to patients what I'm doing and why. So my consultations changed from an eye wink to an average of 15 minutes,\" he says.\nDuring that time patients might be offered a range of interventions to improve their health provided locally, which frees up time for the GP.\nThese include subsidised gym sessions, access to different sports and nutrition advice as well as screening programmes to reduce loneliness as well as increasing healthiness.\nIt is being run by a company called Gesundes Kinzigtal in which the doctors are majority shareholders.\nAlready a couple of years into their 10-year project, they say healthcare is costing 6% less than you would expect for the population.\nThey are trying to improve data sharing and believe hospital treatment can be reduced further.\nMuch of the vision comes from its chief executive Helmut Hildebrandt, a pharmacist and public health expert.\nHe says the health insurance funds have tended to concentrate on short-term cost control measures, rather than improving the health of their patients.\n\"At the moment the economy in Germany runs so well they don't have a problem. But in the long run every politician or administrator knows in the next 10 or 20 years the system will run into a crisis.\"\nHe fears that could undermine the commitment to the health insurance covering most Germans, with a risk of richer people opting out of it.\nWhat Gesundes Kinzigtal is trying to do is similar to some integrated care projects in the NHS.\nThere is more money in the German system, but arguably more waste too.\nThe Caesarean rate is higher, so is the use of MRI for diagnosis and the length of hospital stay.\nAnd in many ways there has been little incentive for change in a system where doctors still have a high degree of influence and life expectancy in Germany is not higher than the UK.\nBernadette Klapper heads the health section of the Robert Bosch Foundation, which funds social policy innovation.\n\"I think we should get more for the money we spend inside healthcare.
