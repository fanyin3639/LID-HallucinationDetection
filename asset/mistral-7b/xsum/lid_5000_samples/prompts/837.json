She earned \u00a330,000 after clinching the title with a second place finish in Zurich on 1 September.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"The Diamond League is the elite of the elite,\" she told BBC Scotland. \"A lot of people that win them are Olympic or world medallists so to win the overall title is so surreal. I can't believe it.\n\"We didn't target the Diamond League as such. We just did the races to fit my training schedules and for peaking in Rio. I didn't run a few of them, so to come away with the title, I am so shocked really.\"\nMuir wrapped up her season by winning the mile race at the Great North City Games last Saturday.\nAnd with the World Championships coming to London next summer, she has another major target to aim for.\nBut as well as winter training, she will spend the next few months focusing on her studies, having passed her fourth year of veterinary school earlier this summer.\n\"I think I can carry it on,\" she added. \"I am very lucky that I have a very supportive school. The University of Glasgow Veterinary School have been great in allowing me to juggle things and I just hope when I graduate, I would like to continue doing both.\n\"I never dreamed of being a full-time athlete. I know at any point it could finish.\n\"You hope it doesn't happen but you never know when you might knacker your knee, and that is you [finished].
