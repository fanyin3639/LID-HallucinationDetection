Less than 200,000 are in refugee camps. The rest have merged into local communities like this.\nMany of the refugees in Mufraq come from the south of Syria which has strong tribal links with the area.\n\"Jordanians are very tolerant people,\" says Jeff Tudor, the UK's head of development in Jordan.\n\"But like any visitors, after four to five years when resources are scarce you have the opportunity for more tension.\"\nJordanians have less access to decent health care because Syrians are going into the health system.\nThe Jordanian government have taken 130,000 Syrian children into their schools. There is enormous added pressure on almost every local resource.\nHeba Asad works as a community outreach leader at Mercy Corps.\nShe says the ideas for the project come from the local community and the Syrian refugees.\nBy establishing joint projects like the community centre and football pitch the hope is inevitable tensions can be reduced and managed.\nSteve Gordon, from Mercy Corps, says most people have the idea refugees are in camps and confined spaces, but most go into the wider community.\nHe says: \"In a camp you know where they are and can assist them because they are in a focused area.\"\nReaching the refugees who aren't in the camps is harder.\nMany aren't registered as refugees and so may not want to come forward and identify themselves.\nKhaled, the former judge, is a registered refugee.\nHe receives some aid but registration also means he can't work to support himself and his family.\nRefugees caught working illegally can find themselves deported back to Syria.\nFor that reason refugee children are often the ones who are sent to work.\nThey are too young to be deported, so it is safer and can bring vital income to desperately poor families.\nFor the aid agencies it raises a whole range of issues, not least the danger of a lost generation.\nKids who miss an education, and become mired in poverty and hopelessness.\nThat mixture, the history of the Middle East has taught, creates a breeding ground for radicalisation.\nJeff Tudor from DFID says: \"The problem we are facing now is if the war in Syria continues for four, five, six years what will people do after they leave education. There has to be some hope for the future for them.\"\nFor most of the refugees their hope would be to simply return to the homes they fled from.\nBut while the fighting continues across the border there is no hope of that.\nFor governments, for aid agencies the challenge is to create a better life for them now, here in Jordan, or in Scotland and elsewhere in Europe.\nKhaled Holany has applied to come to Britain.\nHis application is pending, and poignantly he asks if talking to the BBC might help.
