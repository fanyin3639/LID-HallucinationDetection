Assets fund regeneration, housing and jobs for communities, improve the quality of life for residents and help keep down council tax.\n\"Many assets were built as part of housing developments and are integral to providing the essential shops and amenities communities rely on. In many cases, councils will own the land facilities are built on and not the facilities themselves.\"\nCommunities and Local Government Secretary Greg Clark said local taxpayers \"have a right to know, and demand\", that their money is being spent carefully and effectively.\n\"Councils must keep council tax down and efficiently manage their assets to ensure local taxpayers' money is delivering value for money and the services local people want to see,\" he added.\nSummary:\n",
