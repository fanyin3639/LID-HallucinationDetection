    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nToday I'd like to have a look at some of the smaller figures in the dossier, in particular some of the zeros.\nOne of the most prominent zeros is the amount of money the Conservatives say would be raised by increasing the top rate of income tax from 45p to 50p on incomes over \u00a3150,000.\nThere's a lot of history behind this figure - when the government cut the rate from 50p to 45p it said that would reduce the direct tax take by \u00a3110m a year and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) agreed.\nIncidentally, some Conservatives say that lowering the top rate has actually increased the tax take. While there is some economic theory to back this up it is by no means undisputed.\nBut research from HM Revenue and Customs concluded that considerably more than \u00a3110m had been lost through other forms of taxation such as VAT as a result of the higher rate, hence the zero rating.\nBut Labour points to warnings from the OBR about the uncertainty involved in putting a value on the tax change.\nLabour says the 50p tax raised an extra \u00a33bn before account was taken of people changing their behaviour to avoid the tax and that the government should have found ways to tackle the avoidance instead of cutting the tax.\nMuch of the uncertainty is to do with how short a period the policy was in place, which allowed people to move income away from years with the 50p top rate.\nLabour hasn't yet said how much it expects to raise from the 50p rate, but I think we can reasonably assume it will predict a positive figure.\nWhile we're looking at zeros, abolishing the New Homes Bonus and reallocating the funds within local government is given as both a cost of \u00a31.17bn and a revenue raiser of \u00a31.17bn.\nThere are plenty of other zeros in the report, mainly for policies (or alleged policies) that would not take effect until later in the next Parliament.\nOne of those zeros is another hit for those earning over \u00a3150,000 a year, which would limit the amount of tax relief they can get on their pension contributions.\nThe Treasury gives it a zero for money raised because it says that even if it is introduced in an emergency budget straight after the election, it could not take effect for two years because individuals, companies and the government would need time to prepare for such a change.\nLabour have said they would get the money in as soon as possible but that actually the Treasury had worked out that the policy would eventually raise more than it had expected.\nSo what do these zeros tell us about the forthcoming election campaign?\nWell I already concluded that the costing exercise was jumping the gun a bit, coming several months before any manifestos have been published.\nBut all these zeros also highlight the importance of looking at the effect of a policy over a whole Parliament and not just the first year of it.\nSummary:\n",
