    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nBarca arrived in Spain's capital with a 2-1 advantage from the first leg but poor defending allowed the unmarked Griezmann to power home Saul's cross.\nSaul headed against the bar as Barca toiled before Griezmann scored a late penalty after Andres Iniesta handled.\nBarca were denied a penalty when Gabi handled just inside the area.\nThe defeat ended Luis Enrique's hopes of securing a La Liga, Champions League and Copa del Rey treble, while Atletico join Bayern Munich, Manchester City and Real Madrid in Friday's semi-final draw (11:30 BST).\nRelive the action from Wednesday's Champions League quarter-finals\nBarcelona's players surrounded the referee after Gabi clearly handled inside the area though he was standing outside it, the referee awarding only a free-kick.\nListen again:'Simeone is the archetypal baddie'\nBut Barca were a shadow of the team that conquered Europe so convincingly last season and have now lost three of the last four games in all competitions.\nIn addition, Lionel Messi failed to score for the fifth game in a row for his club, and Neymar and Luis Suarez were frustrated by excellent home defending.\nOn the rare occasions Suarez managed to work an opening he found Jan Oblak in fine form on a great night for Atletico.\nThe tie was littered with late challenges - there were eight bookings in total - while there were two flashpoints as Barca exited the competition on a bad-tempered note.\nSuarez caught Uruguay team-mate Diego Godin with an elbow that left the Atletico defender with a swelling above his eye.\nAnd another scuffle between the top two clubs in Spain broke out when Neymar appeared to lash out at Juanfran from behind.\nBarca enjoyed 77% possession and had more shots than Atletico , yet could not disguise their frustration as they were undone by Griezmann's double.\nThis was the eighth meeting in 15 months between the sides, with Barcelona having won the previous seven.\nIndeed, Atletico's most recent win over their oppoents was at this stage of the Champions League two years ago.\nBarcelona suffered a 2-1 aggregate defeat in 2014 with Diego Simeone's side eventually reaching the final - only to lose 4-1 to Real Madrid after extra time.\nSimeone will be confident after this fine performance that his side can go one better this time.\nMessi remains on 499 career goals, just as he has done since 30 March when he scored for Argentina.\nHe has gone 452 minutes without scoring for Barcelona.\nOn Wednesday, Messi did not look like finding the net as he failed to register a shot on target in a Champions League game for the first time since 2014 - also against Atletico.\nThe 28-year-old cut a frustrated figure as Godin and Lucas Hernandez produced commanding performances at the heart of the home defence.\nMessi's last touch of the game was a free-kick on the edge of the area, when they should have had a penalty, which flew wide.\nIt summed up Barcelona's night.\nBarcelona are three points clear at the top of La Liga with six games remaining. They will look to put this result behind them when they entertain Valencia on Sunday (19:30 BST)\nAtletico host Granada  on the same day at 17:15 BST.\nSummary:\n",
