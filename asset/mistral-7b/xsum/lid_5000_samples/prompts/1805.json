    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nThere are foreign cameras everywhere in Tanzania, and no, they are not taking selfies, instead they are keeping a watchful eye on the country.\nIn any election, any other year, hardly anyone outside the country's borders would pay any attention to Tanzanians as they vote, because Tanzania is one of the most peaceful and stable countries in Africa.\nPresidents are voted into office and leave without a strong military hand or popular protests shoving them out the door.\nSince independence Tanzania has had four presidents who between them have served a total of 54 years.\n'Jumped ship'\nBut this election is different and a number of factors have combined to turn the sleepy Tanzanian political landscape into an intense battlefield.\nTo begin with, for the first time ever, the main opposition parties, including Chadema, have joined forces to support one candidate for the presidency.\nThis opposition umbrella is known by its Swahili acronym, Ukawa.\nIn 2002 in neighbouring Kenya, a similar opposition umbrella group delivered a fatal blow to the ruling Kanu party, which had been in power for 40 years since independence.\nSecondly incumbent Jakaya Kikwete has to leave office having served the maximum two five-year terms allowed by the constitution, so the stage is set therefore for a new president.\nThirdly, Edward Lowassa, a key figure in the ruling CCM party, and who served as prime minister, jumped ship shortly before the campaigns and is the now the greatest challenge to the party.\nHe is Ukawa's presidential candidate and he knows the spots that hurt within CCM.\nFourthly there is the youth factor and the undecided voters: More than half of the 22,750,789 registered voters are aged between 18-35 years.\nMany of them are first-time voters - which means no-one can tell which way their vote will go.\nJoseph Warungu:\n\"When money, politics and power converge, you can expect fireworks\"\nUnlike other elections, modern campaign methods are all the rage in this election.\nThe use of helicopters by the main parties and some prominent candidates makes it easy to criss-cross this vast country and hold a number of rallies each day.\nSocial media is a key frontier to conquer in this election and a strong web presence is mandatory.\nFinally, there is the money factor.\nJudging by the amount of live radio and TV advertising that has been purchased by the parties and candidates, as well as the forest of party posters, banners, billboards and flags everywhere, it is clear the main parties are loaded with cash.\nWhen money, politics and power converge, you can expect fireworks.\nBut CCM is an experienced electoral machine with a solid loyal block of supporters.\nIts presidential candidate John Magufuli comes largely scandal-free and has a reputation for being a \"mchapa kazi\"  - a hard worker who delivers on his word.\nHe will be no push-over.\n'Sharpened focus'\nSo what do they main players in this election want?\nBut what do the ordinary Tanzanians want?\nAll they want is food on their tables, jobs to support their families, a reliable and affordable health care system and quality education.\nSafe drinking water and reliable efficient infrastructure are also top on their list.\nEvery voter in Africa wants and needs these same things. Tanzanians too deserve them.\nThey are looking for a leader who will deliver this promise and sustain the peace and stability the country has enjoyed since independence.\nFor now the many foreign cameras in Tanzania will sharpen their focus as the day approaches for Tanzania to decide who they really really want.\nSummary:\n",
