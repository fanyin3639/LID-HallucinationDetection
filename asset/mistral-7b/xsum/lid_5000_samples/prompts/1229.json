I thought the front two, with and without the ball, were excellent.\n\"Their quality with the ball is there to be seen because their goal tally says so - 20 goals (for Lee Gregory), 12 for Steve Morison, they're a good pair.\n\"There's a spirit about us and we dig in for each other.\"\nPeterborough boss Graham Westley told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire:\n\"They played pretty much as we thought they would, there were no surprises for us, we prepared for everything that came our way.\n\"We didn't execute the job that we came here to do. I don't think in possession we took anywhere near enough responsibility for the ball.\n\"I don't think we developed our forward game in any serious way.\n\"We didn't box clever, things we knew they did undid us, which is naive, and I think we're capable of better than that.\"\nSummary:\n",
