    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nIt called on Houthi rebels to surrender their military gains and everyone to get behind the 2011 Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) initiative and the recently completed draft constitution.\nJamal Benomar, the UN special envoy to Yemen, is worried that instead of successfully implementing the GCC initiative, the country might be heading towards civil war. His concerns are valid.\nBut a multi-polar balance of military power and indigenous political mediation might yet forestall widespread violence.\nHere is a brief synopsis of the GCC initiative.\nIn 2011, there was a mass uprising/camp-out across Yemen. It was mostly peaceful, although more than 50 demonstrators were killed in March, and President Ali Abdullah Saleh himself was seriously injured in an assassination attempt in June.\nWhile Mr Saleh was recuperating in Saudi Arabia, leaders of a National Dialogue that had tried to negotiate the impasse between Northern and Southern leaders before the outbreak of a civil war in 1994 re-launched that Dialogue.\nThis project was overtaken by the GCC deal with Mr Saleh, whereby he handed presidential power to his hand-picked Vice-President, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, in exchange for immunity.\nMr Saleh also remained the head of the ruling General People's Congress (GPC) party, which in turn retained its parliamentary majority.\nThis deal was signed in Saudi Arabia, with witnesses from the Gulf monarchies but not Yemen's \"revolutionary youth\".\nA National Dialogue Conference (NDC) was also convened as part of the deal.\nIt was a very good idea, grounded in Yemeni precedents, and helped tamp down tensions in 2012 and part of 2013. But in the end it did not deliver.\nAlthough the NDC involved young and/or female intellectuals and technocrats, most delegates were aging politicians.\nWorking groups tackled a range of issues - from economic development to the Houthi and Southern problems, respectively, although those dissident groups were under-represented in the negotiations. Some working groups made real progress.\nHowever, the NDC became a donor-dominated transitology project, envisioned by foreign experts and GCC backers rather than Yemeni activists.\nSome 560 delegates earned generous per diems to meet in the five-star Moevenpick Hotel in suburban Sanaa, where international consultants' lectures were simultaneously translated into Arabic before everyone enjoyed excellent buffet lunches.\nThe rent-driven conference persisted, irresolutely, well beyond its initial timeline.\nIronically, a major outcome - the federalism proposal dividing the country into six administrative regions, as recommended by the World Bank - was not on the agenda, mission statement or committee structure of the NDC.\nIt seemed to be based on the utterly failed federal constitution of Iraq rather than on any on-the-ground demands for local autonomy in Yemen.\nAccordingly, the draft constitution endorsed by the UN proposed a radical rewriting of a political order heretofore based on 21 governorates.\nThe newly proposed governance model neither addressed the demands of the revolutionary youth nor provided for the decentralised federalism most Yemenis want.\nFor instance, or especially, it remade the House of Representatives, the lower house of parliament, to consist of 260 members elected through a nationwide vote under a closed proportional list system - instead of the 301 district constituency seats in the previous House.\nOther provisions for electing a new upper house or even the next president and vice-president lack either popular support or genuinely federal logic.\nMr Benomar, the GCC, the UN and G-10 hoped to placate Yemenis' aspirations for social justice via managed negotiations among factions of the ancien regime and anti-democratic Gulf monarchies.\nBut anti-systemic movements - the ragtag Houthi militia astonished by the lack of resistance to their advance against the flailing \"transitional\" regime; the separatist Southern Movement (Hiraak al-Janoubi), also marginalised from the National Dialogue but now taking up arms; fringe Yemeni and foreign Salafist fighters for al-Qaeda; and divisions of what used to be Mr Saleh's security apparatus - are jockeying for power in the new order.\nMr Benomar rightfully frets that the collapse of UN-sponsored talks between the Houthis and the main political factions might embolden multiple well-armed forces to resort to military struggle.\nThe GCC initiative to ward off revolutionary democratisation in the Arabian Peninsula via a managed dialogue has already aborted.\nClashes between and among rival factions are reported in various locations, including Sanaa and the oil-rich desert governorate of Marib. However these are localised gun battles over particular installations, whether government buildings or oil facilities.\nHiraak, certainly, Marib tribes, and even the Houthis are fighting for self-governance and seats at the negotiating table rather than control of the central government.\nThe national army, split since March 2011, has not seriously resisted Houthi advances.\nThe erstwhile President Hadi resigned and moved to Aden rather than battling for control of Sanaa.\nBrinksmanship might get out of hand, of course, but no one faction can hope to rule the country by force alone, and all remain wary of mayhem.\nWarfare is diplomacy by other means. There is still a glimmer of hope for genuine multiparty National Dialogue.\nDr Sheila Carapico is professor of political science and international studies at the University of Richmond, Virginia\nSummary:\n",
