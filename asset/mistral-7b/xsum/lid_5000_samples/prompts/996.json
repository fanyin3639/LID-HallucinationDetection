    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nIn China, the authorities intervened again on the stock market to little effect. Shares in Shanghai fell 3.4%.\nAnd expectations of a US interest rate rise dimmed after the Federal Reserve said the economy was not ready yet.\nIn the US, the Dow Jones closed down more than 2%, while markets in Paris and Frankfurt also fell more than 2%. The UK's FTSE 100 closed down 0.56%.\nOil prices had a mixed day. After dropping at first - adding to steep falls seen on Wednesday - US crude recovered to stand up 20 cents at $41.47 a barrel, although Brent crude was down 54 cents at $46.62.\nMarkets have become increasingly nervous over prospects for the global economy, especially with signs that the Chinese economy is slowing.\nThe devaluation of China's currency, the yuan, last week took many by surprise, and the Chinese stock market has continued to see big fluctuations despite efforts by Beijing to calm markets.\nOn Thursday, Chinese shares fell again, with the benchmark Shanghai Composite index closing 3.4% lower at 3,664.29.\nOn Wednesday, minutes from last month's meeting of the US Federal Reserve flagged up China as a potential problem, saying that a \"material slowdown\" in the Chinese economy could affect the US economic outlook.\nThe US central bank's meeting came before last week's action by China to weaken its currency.\n\"The Chinese slowdown is hugely important for the global economy and we can see the impact of this slowly spreading across East Asia, the commodity producers and now reaching a wider set of countries,\"  Lord Turner, the former chairman of the Financial Services Authority, told the BBC.\n\"I think what is going on in the industrial sectors of the economy, they maybe actually in recession and the official figures that show there is 7% growth - I think they are simply not credible.\"\nThe Federal Reserve's key interest rate has been kept near zero since December 2008, although there has been speculation that the Fed will raise rates at its meeting in September.\nThe latest minutes from the Fed were seen as giving little direction as to whether a rate rise in September was on the cards.\nThey showed that most policymakers thought conditions for a US rate rise \"were approaching\", but the economy was not ready yet.\nThere was also concern that inflation would remain weak because of the strong dollar and falling commodity prices, which act as a double depressant on imports.\nLord Turner said that a rise in US interest rates and the dollar would have a \"large impact\" on emerging markets, especially corporate borrowers, who have borrowed in dollars.\n\"I think as long as we only see a small increase in US interest rates that's not too big an impact, but if there was a 1% or 2% increase over a short period of time, that would be a major shock to the world economy.\"\nLord Turner said he did not believe there was a risk of another financial crisis similar to the one in 2008 because the banking system was more robust, but he feared there were unresolved imbalances in the global economy.\nAlthough oil prices appeared to stabilise on Thursday, they had fallen sharply on Wednesday following the release of data showing that US oil stockpiles were higher than expected.\nThe price of oil has more than halved over the past year, due to a combination of increased supplies and slowing demand.\nThe low oil prices are creating pressures on economies that are dependent on oil revenues.\nAmong them is energy-rich Kazakhstan, the biggest economy of Central Asia, which has announced it is floating its currency, the Tenge.\nAs a result, the Tenge dropped by almost a quarter in one day.\nOther emerging market currencies also came under pressure on Thursday, with the Turkish lira briefly touching a record low of 3.0 to the US dollar.\nSummary:\n",
