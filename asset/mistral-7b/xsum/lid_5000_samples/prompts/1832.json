[in] the woods when the plane dropped a bomb near me but I wasn't hurt.\n\"We had no food for one month and 10 days but we did not die. We thank God,\" she added, speaking in the local Hausa language.\nMany of the kidnapped students were Christian but had been forcibly converted to Islam during captivity.\nAnother girl said: \"We never imagined that we would see this day but, with the help of God, we were able to come out of enslavement.\"\nExcited relatives were waiting to be reunited with the girls, who were released last Thursday.\nOne parent said: \"We thank God. I never thought I was going to see my daughter again but here she is... Those who are still out there - may God bring them back to be reunited with their parents.\"\nNigerian authorities have denied reports that captured Boko Haram fighters were swapped for the girls. But one security official told the BBC that four commanders had been freed.\nThe AP news agency also reported that a \"handsome ransom\", in the millions of dollars, was paid by the Swiss government on behalf of the Nigerian government.\nNigeria's Information Minister Lai Mohammed said Thursday's release was \"the first step\" for the liberation of all the remaining girls.\n\"Already we are on phase two and we are already in discussions,\" he told journalists on Sunday.\n\"But of course you know these are very delicate negotiations, there are some promises we made also about the confidentiality of the entire exercise and we intend to keep them.\"\nSome of the kidnapped girls managed to escape within hours of their kidnapping, mostly by jumping off lorries and running into nearby bushes.\nIn total, 219 girls were captured and taken away.
