    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nIn a letter to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, Mr Pachauri said he was unable to provide strong leadership.\nIndian police are investigating a complaint from a 29-year-old woman working in his office in Delhi.\nLawyers for the woman say the harassment included unwanted emails as well as text and phone messages. Mr Pachauri has denied the allegations.\nMr Pachauri, who had chaired the IPCC since 2002 and whose second term was due to end in October this year, denies any wrongdoing and says his email account and mobile phone were hacked.\nHis office at the Energy and Resources Institute in Delhi (TERI) said he had gone on \"long leave\" from the organisation.\nOn Monday, the 74-year-old had pulled out of a high-level IPCC meeting in Kenya starting on Tuesday, because of \"issues demanding his attention in India\", an IPCC spokesman said.\nIn his letter to the UN secretary general, Mr Pachauri said his inability to travel to Kenya showed that he might not be able to provide the \"strong leadership and dedication\" needed by the panel.\n\"I have therefore taken the decision to step down from my position as chair of the IPCC some months before completion of my term,\" he wrote.\nDr Pachauri\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation is a shock - but it is unlikely to create lasting damage to the IPCC as he was due to retire, and potential replacements are already throwing hats in the ring.\nGood luck to them: the IPCC chair is one of the most gruelling and controversial jobs on the international stage.\nThe chair has to spend much of his life in mid-air, flitting between capitals, whilst suffering relentless attacks from campaigners challenging climate science.\nKnown to friends as \"Patchy\", Dr Pachauri's tenure has been controversial. He was installed after the US said the previous chair was too alarmist. They thought Dr Pachauri, as an Indian transport economist, would take a pro-development line.\nAfter immersion in scientific research he too became persuaded that climate change is a real threat, deserving more action from political leaders \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and he said so in outspoken terms.\nThe US then resisted his bid for a second term as chair, but Dr Pachauri was supported by developing countries, who appreciated his willingness to prod the main perpetrators of climate change.\nProfile Rajendra Pachauri\nThe IPCC has since confirmed that its vice-chairman Ismail El Gizouli will be chairing the four-day meeting in the Kenyan capital which is meant to pave the way for an international agreement in December on curbing carbon emissions.\nThe move will \"ensure that the IPCC's mission to assess climate change continues without interruption,\" said Achim Steiner, executive director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP).\nIn 2007 Mr Pachauri collected the Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of the organisation for its work in the scientific assessment of the risks and causes of climate change. The IPCC shared the award with former US vice-president and environmental campaigner, Al Gore.\nIn 2010 Mr Pachauri rejected pressure to step down when errors were found in the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report.\nSummary:\n",
