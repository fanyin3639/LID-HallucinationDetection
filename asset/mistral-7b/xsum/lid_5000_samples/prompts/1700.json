    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nAhead of their child obesity strategy, ministers asked Public Health England to review the evidence on how to reduce sugar consumption.\nBut PHE has come under criticism for not releasing the findings of its report.\nAnd the body has now confirmed a sugar tax is one of its recommendations.\nThe acknowledgement came after PHE director of diet and obesity Dr Alison Tedstone appeared before MPs on Tuesday saying the organisation \"does see a role for a fiscal approach\" and the higher the tax increase \"the greater the effect\".\nAfterwards, sources at PHE confirmed the report specifically called for him to consider a sugar tax, adding this was not the most important of its recommendations.\nIn her evidence to the Health Select Committee Dr Tedstone said action was also needed on promotions and advertising, citing:\nThe food industry must also be pressured to cut the amount of sugar in its products in the same way it had done with salt, Dr Tedstone said.\nBut she added: \"PHE does see there is a role for a fiscal approach in reducing sugary drink consumption.\n\"The higher the tax increase the greater the effect,\" she said, pointing out that in Mexico a fizzy drinks tax had led to a 6% fall in consumption, with the biggest impact on the poorest people.\n\"The point of the tax is to nudge people away from purchasing these things towards purchasing things that are more consistent with a healthy balanced diet,\" she said.\nHowever, Dr Tedstone also said that her review had concluded tax was only the fourth most effective way to fight obesity.\n\"We think there could be bigger impacts from getting a handle on promotions, and of getting a handle on the deep, consistent advertising our children are exposed to on unhealthy foods,\" she said.\nAbout 40% of food sold in England was discounted and these deals were \"heavily weighted\" towards sweet and fatty products, Dr Tedstone's research found.\nShe said these promotions did not cut costs for consumers but simply \"lead to us buying more food\".\nShe added: \"PHE are advising that promotions need to be restricted and rebalanced if we want to reduce sugar consumption.\"\nHer appearance before MPs followed that of her boss, Duncan Selbie, on Monday, who had to defend the non-release of the report in a tense session.\nHe said there was \"no conspiracy\" and it would be released alongside the government's child obesity strategy in January.\nThe view within PHE is that as the review was commissioned by ministers, it is up to them to release it.\nThe Department of Health said it would be considering the PHE recommendations as it drew up its strategy.\nSummary:\n",
