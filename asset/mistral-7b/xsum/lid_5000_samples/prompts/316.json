    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nRetired solicitor Donald Lock was stabbed 39 times on the A24 at Findon, West Sussex, last July.\nMatthew Daley, 35, denies murder but has admitted killing Mr Lock, claiming diminished responsibility.\nIn an video played at Lewes Crown Court he told police he saw Mr Lock in his rear view mirror looking \"very angry\".\n\"I just saw someone very close and very angry and I wanted that scenario to stop because it was intrusive,\" said Mr Daley.\n\"It was aggressive. I know some people drive close sometimes but this person was very, very close and I didn't know why.\n\"I thought he would see my red lights and think maybe he shouldn't be driving so close to me, because that's not how people are supposed to drive.\"\nThe pensioner's widow, Maureen Lock, left the courtroom when Mr Daley showed police during the interview how he had stabbed her husband.\nMr Lock was fatally stabbed after he hit the back of the defendant's Ford Fusion in July and then asked why he had braked so abruptly.\nMr Daley continued: \"I'm not happy that the man has died. I'm not happy that in the final minutes of his life he was in that much pain, and I don't want to be reminded of it.\n\"I feel very sorry about what I have done and I don't want to see anything like that happen in my lifetime again.\"\nWhen he was asked why he did not stop stabbing Mr Lock after he fell to the ground, he replied: \"It's as if his anger has been put on to me and I'm trying to get rid of it.\"\nWhen asked why he had to use a knife, Mr Daley said it was \"in his mind to protect himself\".\nHe also said he had stopped taking medication to help him sleep a year before the attack.\nDuring the interview he said he had recently split up from his girlfriend but was \"making efforts to win her back\".\nJurors have been told Mr Daley had suffered from mental health problems for 10 years, and his family had \"pleaded\" with mental health experts to have him sectioned.\nDefence counsel David Howker QC told the court he would not be calling Mr Daley to give evidence, but added: \"There is other evidence to call.\"\nThe court heard Mr Daley saw consultant forensic psychiatrist Jake Harvey the day after the killing and told him he felt he had been getting less help with his mental health, was being seen by \"too many trainee nurses\", and had not been taking an anti-psychotic drug he had previously been prescribed.\nHe described hearing \"so many juvenile voices running through my head\" which he said were \"angry\" and \"overwhelming\", jurors heard.\nIn a statement, Mr Harvey said although he believed Mr Daley had a mental disorder, he was not so acutely mentally unwell that he needed urgent transfer for psychiatric treatment, and was fit to be charged.\nConsultant clinical psychologist Dr Michael Lawson assessed Mr Daley in November 2015 when he was admitted to Hellingly medium-secure unit.\nHe said his primary diagnosis was paranoid schizophrenia and exaggerated autistic traits.\nHe said: \"My conclusion was that at the time of the alleged offence, Mr Daley was in all likelihood beginning to break down and experiencing the acute symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia, although I don't think he was at the point of being incapacitated.\"\nThe case continues.\nSummary:\n",
