They also contain 0.1% of the total number of genes in a person.\nCytoplasm: The jelly like substance that contains the nucleus and mitochondria\nThe regulations put before Parliament state:\nIn practice it means that only the most severely affected women - perhaps 10 cases per year - would go ahead.\nAnd doctors in Newcastle, where the technique has been pioneered, would initially be the centre offering it.\nThe regulations will remain in draft form until they are voted on by Parliament and are signed off by ministers.\nThis is expected to take place before the general election in May 2015.\nPublic Health Minister Jane Ellison said: \"The government considers that the time is now right to give Parliament the opportunity to consider and vote on these regulations.\"\nProf Doug Turnbull, from Newcastle University, told BBC News: \"I'm delighted that it's being moved forward to the next stage.
