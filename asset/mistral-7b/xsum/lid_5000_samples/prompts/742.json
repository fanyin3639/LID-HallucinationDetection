But with the opposition boycotting the vote and with the security forces controlling the cities in riot gear it was always going to be an uncontested election.\nThe challenge will be governing afterwards in this conflicted political environment.\nThe election has been heavily criticised by other Latin American countries as well as by the European Union and the US.\nVenezuela has said it will withdraw from the Organisation of American States (OAS) after members including the US, Canada and Mexico said they would not recognise the authority of the assembly.\nVenezuela has already been suspended from regional economic bloc Mercosur by fellow-members Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, following concern over human rights.\nOn Sunday, the US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, dismissed the vote as a \"sham election\" and a \"step towards dictatorship\".\nEnd of Twitter post  by @nikkihaley\nThe US, which has already imposed sanctions on 13 members of Mr Maduro's government, signalled on Sunday it was considering further measures, this time targeting the oil industry.\nAn official quoted by Reuters said the new sanctions were not expected to include a ban on Venezuelan oil shipments to the US but could stop the sale of lighter US crude that Venezuela mixes with its heavy crude and then exports.\n\"Even if they win today, this won't last long,\" opposition supporter Berta Hernandez, a 60-year-old doctor, told Reuters in Caracas. \"I'll continue on the streets because, not long from now, this will come to an end.\"\nMr Maduro cast his own ballot shortly after polling stations opened at 06:00 (10:00 GMT).\nIn a televised speech, he predicted a \"big victory\", calling the vote \"the most important election held in Venezuela's political system\".\nHowever, electoral council chief Tibisay Lucena acknowledged that some voting machines had been attacked and burned in parts of the country.\nFour months of protests against Mr Maduro and his plans for the assembly have left more than 100 people dead.\nVenezuela, a major oil producer, is gripped by a political crisis, with soaring inflation and daily food shortages.\nMany residents in Caracas were stocking up on essential items on Saturday in case unrest left shops closed into Monday, correspondents said.\nSummary:\n",
