I thought if we can get actual forms of people bothered about it, then it might help.\"\nShe said the matter had been discussed in one of her university classes and \"everyone in the room was absolutely horrified\".\nThe charity Rethink Mental Illness has carried out a poll on Twitter to gauge people's views.\nPaul Jenkins, its chief executive officer, said: \"While some people clearly feel very strongly about this, opinion has been mixed.\n\"While of course there's nothing wrong with a bit of Halloween fun, explicit references to 'patients' crosses a line and reinforces damaging stereotypes about mental illness.\"\nIn September, supermarket chains Tesco and Asda withdrew two Halloween outfits after they were criticised for stigmatising people with mental health issues.\nAsda dropped its \"mental patient fancy dress costume\", and Tesco later withdrew its \"psycho ward\" outfit.\nIn a statement, a Thorpe Park spokeswoman said the negative comments were not \"universally representative\".\n\"This is primarily a matter of context. The maze is not something you happen upon when out shopping,\" she said.\n\"This maze is also in its eighth year of operation and is an obviously extreme and simulated experience which draws on classic horror film content.\n\"It is not intended, nor is it deemed to be by those who have actually experienced it, to be in any way offensive or to be a realistic portrayal of a mental health or indeed any other institution.\"\nSummary:\n",
