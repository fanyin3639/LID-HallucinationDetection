    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nThe monarch said she was \"deeply saddened\" to learn of his death.\nA vigil was attended by hundreds outside Trafalgar Square's South Africa House, after David Cameron earlier visited to offer his condolences.\nMeanwhile, books of condolence have been opened across the country, and flags are flying at half-mast.\nThe Queen said the former South African president \"worked tirelessly\" for the good of his country, adding that his legacy is \"the peaceful South Africa we see today\".\nA statement from Buckingham Palace said: \"Her Majesty remembers with great warmth her meetings with Mr Mandela\".\nBy Philippa ThomasBBC News\nAmong the flowers and flickering candles at the entrance to South Africa House, the message that stands out is \"Thank you Madiba\".\nHundreds gathered for a vigil on Friday night, holding signs and a long moment of silence, and then singing. But organiser Xolani Xala, head of the ANC in Europe, said: \"We didn't make this happen. He did.\"\nThe long line to sign the book of condolence has been closed - but it will open again at 09:30 GMT on Saturday.\nI've met people of many nationalities and colours here today - from long-time anti-apartheid activists to those who were toddlers when Mandela was freed.\nLela Kogbara joined the protests here decades ago. She told me that when Mandela first came to London in 1996 as president to Buckingham Palace, she was in a group of five or six campaigners invited to meet him there for breakfast. \"I couldn't sleep. I couldn't eat. I didn't know what to say. And he teased me - 'are you on a diet?', she said.\"\nAnd I met two young student friends from Pretoria - Mandisa Mbele and Rosemary Blersch, now at City and Roehampton universities - who told me that when they heard the news, \"we had to be together and we had to be here\".\nWriting in a book of condolence at South Africa House, the prime minister said of Mr Mandela: \"Your cause of fighting for freedom and against discrimination, your struggle for justice, your triumph against adversity - these things will inspire generations to come.\n\"And through all of this, your generosity, compassion and profound sense of forgiveness have given us all lessons to learn and live by.\"\nHe ended his message with a quote from Matthew 5:9 in the Bible: \"Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God\".\nThe central London site was once the scene of freedom vigils for Mr Mandela, who led South Africa's transition from white-minority rule in the 1990s after serving 27 years in prison for his political activities.\nMembers of the public queued to sign the book as flowers, candles and other tributes gathered outside the South African High Commission.\nOne tribute on a card read: \"Thank you for the sacrifices you made for all of us.\"\nAnother read: \"May God shine light on your homecoming in heaven. Rest in Peace Mr Mandela.\"\nA book of condolence has opened for members of the public to sign at St Margaret's Church, Westminster Abbey. Further books will open at Coventry Cathedral, the city of peace and reconciliation, and at Leeds Civic Hall, after Mr Mandela was made a Freeman of Leeds in 2001.\nSt Paul's Cathedral is to hold an evensong service in memory of Mr Mandela at 17:00 GMT on Thursday.\nA national service of thanksgiving for the life of Mr Mandela is to be held at Westminster Abbey in the new year. The state funeral in South Africa is due to take place on Sunday, 15 December.\nThe Foreign Office said it has requested that all UK national flags across the country be flown at half-mast until 20:00 GMT on Thursday. It also appealed for any foreign flags usually flown on the same stand as the Union Flag to be removed.\nMr Mandela made his first state visit to the UK in 1996, two years after he became South Africa's first black president.\nThe Prince of Wales said Mr Mandela was the \"embodiment of courage and reconciliation\".\nThe prince added: \"He was also a man of great humour and had a real zest for life.\n\"With his passing, there will be an immense void not only in his family's lives, but also in those of all South Africans and the many others whose lives have been changed through his fight for peace, justice and freedom.\n\"The world has lost an inspired leader and a great man. My family and I are profoundly saddened and our thoughts and prayers are with his family. \"On Thursday night, Prince William said the death of Mandela was \"extremely sad and tragic\".\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were attending the premiere of Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, a film about the former South African president, when news of Mr Mandela's death broke.\nSpeaking after the film, Prince William said: \"We were just reminded of what an extraordinary and inspiring man Nelson Mandela was and my thoughts and prayers are with him and his family right now.\"\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, was among others in the UK to pay tribute to Mr Mandela.\nHe said: \"South Africa has lost its greatest citizen and its father.
