    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nPolice took action against Matthew Adams, Daniel Batchelor, Javier Centeno-Gomez and a 17-year-old youth, all from Suffolk, after concerns were raised.\nThe four pleaded guilty to a public order offence of threatening behaviour.\nThey were each fined \u00c2\u00a3100 and banned from climbing manmade buildings.\nPolice said Adams, 23, of Raglan Street, Batchelor, 26, of Newark Road and a 17-year-old boy, all from Lowestoft, and Centeno-Gomez, 24, of Benacre Road, Ellough, near Beccles.\nThey were prosecuted following reports of a number of incidents where men were reported to be climbing on structures around Lowestoft.\nThe ban, which is active for two years, prohibits the four from climbing any structure more than 3m above the ground, unless it is specifically designed to be climbed, or unless they have written permission of the structure's owner and safety equipment is used.\nOfficers showed footage to court from the quartet's head cameras, including images of two of the group lowering themselves over the edge of the roof and hanging off the side of St Peters Court in the town - 15 storeys above the ground.\nIt also showed one of them parachuting from the wind turbine at Kessingland.\nA Suffolk Police spokesman said the threatening behaviour offence relates to them causing alarm and distress to residents of Lowestoft through their climbing and posting footage of their exploits on the internet.\n\"Police felt they had no alternative but to take action due to the extreme danger of their actions. As was pointed out during sentencing, they may have fallen and not only killed themselves but innocent passers-by on the ground,\" he said.\nAdams disputed whether they put lives at risk.\n\"What people don't understand is that we put a lot of training into this. I accept what I am doing is dangerous, but we prepare for it and we don't encourage other people to do it,\" he said.\nThe four appeared at Lowestoft Magistrates' Court on 10 March, where they all pleaded guilty.\nThey were also ordered to pay \u00c2\u00a320 victim compensation and \u00c2\u00a385 costs.\nSummary:\n",
