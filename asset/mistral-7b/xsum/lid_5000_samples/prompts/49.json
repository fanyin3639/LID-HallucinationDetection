    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nItoje, 21, made his senior debut in the 40-9 defeat of Italy, coming off the bench to play blind-side flanker.\nBut he now replaces the injured Joe Launchbury in the second row, ahead of the recalled Courtney Lawes.\nProp Joe Marler replaces Mako Vunipola in the only other change from the team that started in Rome.\n\"Everyone is pushing hard to be in contention, so there were some tight calls on selection,\" said head coach Eddie Jones.\nEngland are chasing a first Six Nations title since 2011 and a first Grand Slam since 2003.\nGoing into the weekend's fixtures, they lead the table on points difference from France, with both teams having won their first two games.\nIreland have made a disappointing start to their defence of the title and sit fourth after a draw with Wales and defeat by France.\nEngland: Mike Brown (Harlequins), Anthony Watson, Jonathan Joseph (both Bath), Owen Farrell (Saracens), Jack Nowell (Exeter), George Ford (Bath), Ben Youngs (Leicester); Joe Marler (Harlequins), Dylan Hartley (Northampton - captain), Dan Cole (Leicester), Maro Itoje, George Kruis (both Saracens), Chris Robshaw (Harlequins), James Haskell (Wasps), Billy Vunipola (Saracens).\nReplacements: Jamie George, Mako Vunipola, Alex Goode (all Saracens), Paul Hill, Courtney Lawes (Northampton), Jack Clifford, Danny Care (Harlequins), Elliot Daly (Wasps).\nBBC Sport's chief sports writer Tom Fordyce:\n\"Itoje has been so highly rated for so long that some of his new England team-mates have started calling him 'the chosen one', but this is as much about genuine hope than hype.\n\"Having started at the same Hertfordshire school as Owen Farrell and George Ford before finishing at the same one as Billy Vunipola, he has been compared to both Martin Johnson and Paul O'Connell by England's defence coach Paul Gustard.\n\"Those may seem lofty comparisons, but there is sound logic there. Itoje is 21 years old as he makes his first international start, while those two second-row legends made their own debuts at 22.

Johnson's defining moment, at the 2003 World Cup, came 10 years on from his debut, while O'Connell's - captaining the Lions, leading Ireland to the Grand Slam - came seven years after his own.\n\"But Itoje has excelled in every age group and competition he has been thrown into, with his power, dynamism and leadership setting him apart.
