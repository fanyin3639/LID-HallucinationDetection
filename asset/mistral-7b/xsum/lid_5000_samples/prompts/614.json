Many are very old and are being stored so that they can be used to rebuild these ancient sites.\nThe soldiers are joined by aid workers - but also tourists. One French visitor said she \"just wanted to help\". But it's an ad hoc approach which characterises the entire relief operation.\nI met rescue and medical teams from France and China. After wandering around they left. \"We don't know what we are supposed to be doing,\" one French rescue worker told me.\nTheir services are required in the remote villages where many are in urgent need of assistance - but they are stuck here in the capital because no-one is telling them what to do.\nThere has been growing anger at the government's response to the disaster, with a number of protests breaking out.\nThe home ministry said on Friday that rescue and relief operations in Kathmandu would focus on devastated pockets of the city including the areas around the central bus terminal and around historic monuments - where there is a small chance people remain trapped in several collapsed tall buildings.\nSearches will also be conducted for survivors around historic monuments in the ancient towns of Patan and Bhaktapur.\nThe tent cities which sprang up around Kathmandu in the days following the quake have almost gone, reports say, as the fear of aftershocks subsides.\nBut the stench of rotting bodies in the rubble has driven officials to order that unclaimed bodies be cremated immediately after they are recovered, Reuters news agency reported.\n$415 million\nneeded for humanitarian relief\n3 million people in need of food aid\n130,000 houses destroyed\n24,000 people living in makeshift camps\n20 teams working to reunite lost children with their families\nHow long can people survive under rubble?\nSatellite reveals quake movement\nNepal quake special report\nBBC's emergency Lifeline service\nIn a statement the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said that Sindhupalchok, north-east of Kathmandu, stood out as one of the worst affected areas.\n\"One of our teams that returned from Chautara in Sindhupalchok district reported that 90% of the homes are destroyed,\" said Jagan Chapagain, head of IFRC's Asia Pacific division.\n\"The hospital has collapsed, and people are digging through the rubble with their hands in the hope that they might find family members who are still alive.\"\nHe added: \"We can expect the situation to be the same if not worse in many other places where aid has not yet been delivered.\"\nIn the capital, shortages of food and water have forced thousands of workers to board buses and flee to their home towns and villages.\nA lack of buses and the slow distribution of aid have led to clashes between protesters and riot police.\nThe UN has also warned of the challenges facing Nepal's farming community, which comprises up to two-thirds of the country's 27 million people.\nIt says that the quake destroyed seed stocks for the mid-May rice sowing season, as well as grains kept dry in stone storage huts that have now been razed to the ground.\nIf farmers miss this month's planting season, they will be unable to harvest rice - Nepal's staple food - until late 2016, the UN says.\nSummary:\n",
