Just let yourself get more and more relaxed and sleepy - don't fight it.\n\"Just cosy up on the couch.

This is Sean on Louise's phone. Got her home.\n\"Walking was a bad idea. She's sleeping now. Snoring away.\"\nMr Woodhouse agreed with a suggestion made by prosecutor Tim Niven Smith that just because a text message was sent from a person's phone, it did not necessarily mean that the phone's owner had composed the text.\nProsecutors allege that on 9 May, 2015, at her home address, and Voodoo Tattoo in the city's Perth Road, Ms McAllister \"did recklessly and unlawfully\" supply controlled and \"potentially lethal\" drugs to Mrs McGowan.\nThe Crown alleges that the drugs supplied to Mrs McGowan were tramadol, diazepam and temazepam.\nMs McAllister is also alleged to have supplied Mrs McGowan with codeine, diphenhydramine and cyclizine.\nThe indictment states Mrs McGowan, of Dundee, \"ingested\" the drugs and died a day later.\nThe trial before judge Graham Buchanan QC continues.\nSummary:\n",
