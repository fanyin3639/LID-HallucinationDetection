Yes I did. But did the business fail because of the amount of money I took out? No it didn't,\" Mr Chappell said.\n\"This was just a drip in the ocean compared to the money that was needed to turn around BHS.\"\nThe loss-making chain was bought by Mr Chappell last year. It went into administration in April and the last stores closed in August, with the loss of about 11,000 jobs and leaving a pensions deficit of hundreds of millions of pounds.\nLast month MPs backed a call to strip Sir Philip of his knighthood for his role in the collapse of BHS.\nThe Pensions Regulator has started legal action against Sir Philip, his family's companies and Mr Chappell after failing to reach a deal over the BHS pension fund deficit.\nThe BBC understands that the regulator wants \u00a3350m in redress from Sir Philip, but he was only willing to offer \u00a3250m.\nSummary:\n",
