    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nLuca Sperandio's try broke the deadlock for the hosts, before Stuart Hogg, Tommy Seymour and Adam Ashe all touched down for Glasgow.\nDean Budd pounced on a Warriors error to score, but Nick Grigg bagged the visitors' fourth try.\nTommaso Allan's boot kept Treviso in touch, and Budd plunged over again to tie the scores before Clegg's clincher.\nThe hosts capitalised on a period of slack Glasgow to open the scoring, Sperandio sniping through the tackles of Ryan Wilson and Henry Pyrgos, with Allan pulling the conversion attempt wide.\nJust 12 minutes later, however, the fly-half's grubber kick bounced straight into the arms of opposite number Hogg, wearing 10 for Glasgow for the first time, and the Scotland international scampered some 80 metres to score.\nThe Warriors struck again almost immediately, the Pro12's top try-scorer, Seymour, bagging his eighth of the season as he finished off a fine move started by full-back Peter Murchie to touch down under the posts.\nHogg converted both tries, and Allan sent what ought to have been a straightforward penalty attempt flying wide from in front of the posts.\nAshe swatted aside Treviso's number eight, Alberto De Marchi, to score Glasgow's third, Hogg again accurate from the tee.\nBut the flanker played his part in gifting the hosts seven points of their own, when he flung a wayward pass into his own in-goal area, the bounce evaded Murchie, and Budd leapt on the loose ball to score, Allan converting.\nThe fly-half knocked over a penalty with the final act of the half to keep Treviso within a score.\nAllan skewed another effort wide two minutes after the break, but did land his second successful penalty to move the Italians within three points of Glasgow.\nCentre Grigg, though, showed brilliant dynamism to power through three tackles and secure the Warriors' bonus-point try, Hogg converting once more.\nAgain, Allan kept Treviso in touch with his boot, slotting a third penalty.\nAnd after a period of sustained pressure, the hosts drew level with six minutes to play, as Budd again dived over from a quick tap-penalty under the posts, with replacement Ian McKinley converting.\nBut from the restart, Glasgow won turnover ball in their own half and swept forward, Sean Lamont breaking the line and finding Seymour, who jinked inside, and offloaded to Clegg.\nThe replacement beat the last man and scrambled over the whitewash, Hogg adding the extras.\nBenetton Treviso: Luke McLean, Angelo Esposito, Tommaso Benvenuti, Luca Morisi, Luca Sperandio, Tommaso Allan, Giorgio Bronzini; Marco Barbini, Abraham Steyn, Robert Barbieri, Dean Budd, Marco Fuser, Matthew Zanusso, Davide Giazzon, Alberto De Marchi.\nReplacements: Roberto Santamaria, Federico Zani, Titian Pasquali, Teofilo Paulo, Marco Lazzaroni, Edoardo Gori, Ian McKinley, Tommaso Iannone.\nGlasgow Warriors: Peter Murchie, Junior Bulumakau, Nick Grigg, Sam Johnson, Tommy Seymour, Stuart Hogg, Henry Pyrgos; Gordon Reid, Pat MacArthur, D'arcy Rae, Tim Swinson, Brian Alainu'uese, Adam Ashe, Chris Fusaro, Ryan Wilson.\nReplacements: Corey Flynn, Alex Allan, Zander Fagerson, Rob Harley, Simone Favaro, Nemia Kenatale, Rory Clegg, Sean Lamont.\nSummary:\n",
