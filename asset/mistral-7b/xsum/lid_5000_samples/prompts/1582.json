DFID and the St Helena government are currently looking at the options for dealing with the problem caused by the wind conditions but have yet to agree on a solution.\nAs part of the plan, the Royal Mail Ship St Helena - which provides the only regular cargo and passenger link to the island - will not be replaced once it is taken out of service, which had been due take place next month.\nSir Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said: \"Estimating the likely costs and benefits of a project such as this is an inherently difficult task, particularly with a limited number of precedents for building an airport in a remote location.\n\"The airport's planned opening date in May 2016 has been postponed as outstanding safety concerns are addressed, potentially adding to the project's cost and delaying its benefits.\"\nA DFID spokesperson said: \"As the report points out, the UK supports its overseas territories in line with international law.\n\"We are helping St Helena overcome the challenge of being one of the most remote island communities in the world so it can develop its tourism industry and become financially self-sufficient, making it less dependent on aid.\"\nSummary:\n",
