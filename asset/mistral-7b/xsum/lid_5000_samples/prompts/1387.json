She has years of torturous negotiations over the EU ahead of her. The prime minister has only a wafer-thin majority and has an appetite for some controversial reforms at home like grammar schools in England and tackling the social care system.\nThere are years of controversial cuts to come. And creeping inflation and sluggish wages mean many people may be feeling the pinch and are increasingly politically grumpy by the time of the scheduled next election.\nThe consensus in Westminster is that if she were to go to the country, Mrs May would end up with a thumping majority. What better reserves of support to have at her back as she contemplates a hard road ahead.\nSome senior Westminster players believe the case is a simple slam-dunk.\nBut Number 10 (until now at least) rebuts it clearly and the fabled consensus can often be wrong.\nSo what are the arguments against such an overtly persuasive case?\nFirst the technicalities.
