It opened the door to cell block C, landing 3, cell 3 in Reading Gaol - where Wilde carried out his hard labour sentence.\nHe was convicted over his homosexual behaviour, considered a crime at that time.\nThe letter on display is the one he wrote to the Pall Mall Gazette on 2 October 1894, to deny claims he had written The Green Carnation, first published anonymously in 1894.\nThe novel's main characters are closely based on Wilde and his lover Lord Alfred Douglas - the latter of whom the real author, Robert Hichens, knew personally.\nThe book, which caused a scandal on both sides of the Atlantic, also formed part of the evidence used against Wilde during his prosecution for indecency. A first edition of the novel is included in the Maltese exhibition.\nMr Spiteri Paris said: \"I became obsessed with Oscar Wilde in 1966 when I was on a working trip in the UK and had gone to watch the play An Ideal Husband.\n\"Since then I must have read every single book about him - I'm fascinated by his genius and complete absence of malice.\"\nThe items will be on display until May.\nSummary:\n",
