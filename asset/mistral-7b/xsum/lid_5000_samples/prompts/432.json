But nine double faults  - another day one high in the ladies' draw - meant she still lost in three sets to Lucie Safarova.\nThe 23rd seed and 2008 French Open winner Ana Ivanovic could not cope with the pressure applied by Ekaterina Alexandrova of Russia.\nThe 21-year-old qualifier was making her Grand Slam debut but defied her world ranking of 228 to hit 19 winners and take four out of five break points over the course of two sets.\nIvanovic, who reached the semi-finals at SW19 in 2007, apportioned some blame to a wrist injury. \"It caused me a lot of miss hits,\" she said.\nNinth seed Madison Keys, winner of the Aegon Classic earlier this month, did not suffer the same upset as Ivanovic, showing good touch in seeing off Laura Siegemund 6-3 6-1 as she looks to improve on a place in the quarter finals last year.\nSubscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.\nSummary:\n",
