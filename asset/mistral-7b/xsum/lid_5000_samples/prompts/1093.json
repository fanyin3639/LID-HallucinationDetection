The ruling has now been published.\nMoyes' comments came following the Black Cats' home draw against Burnley in the Premier League in March.\nThe Scot was asked by Sparks if the presence of Sunderland's owner Ellis Short had put extra pressure on him.\nMoyes responded to Sparks' question about Short's presence by saying \"no\", but after the interview added she \"might get a slap even though you're a woman\" and told her to be \"careful\" next time she visited.\nBoth Moyes and Sparks were laughing during the exchange and the former Everton and Manchester United manager later apologised to Sparks, who did not make a complaint.\nMoyes, who resigned as Sunderland boss in May, subsequently expressed \"deep regret\" for his comment.\n\"That's certainly not the person I am,\" he said. \"I've accepted the mistake. I spoke to the BBC reporter, who accepted my apology.\"\nThe report said: \"It is no answer for Mr Moyes to say that his comments were intended as mere banter, or a joke, and were not to be taken seriously.\n\"We are satisfied from his oral evidence to us that he was at least irritated by what he considered to be a 'rude' question and that he wanted to convey the sense to Ms Sparks that, in asking it, she had crossed what he regarded as an acceptable boundary.\n\"When Ms Sparks asked him whether he felt under any additional pressure due to the presence of the club owner at the match, it was a reasonable question for a journalist to ask and one that he might have anticipated. It did not merit any censure.\n\"We find that the threat of physical violence was not one that a reasonable person viewing the video footage would seriously consider Mr Moyes would carry through with.
