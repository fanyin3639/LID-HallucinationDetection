As well as raising some money, this would mean her name would live on. Plus, Nur Huda is a pretty cool name for a character.\nHe added: \"Please outbid me by lots though - it's an important cause.\"\nAll subsequent bidders have supported Mr Clements's bid to see Nur Hada named in the second novel of Pullman's Book of Dust series.\nPullman wrote: \"This book will follow the first part of The Book of Dust, La Belle Sauvage, which will be published in October this year.\n\"The second part (not yet titled) will follow next year. The right to name a character doesn't guarantee that he or she will be good, bad, beautiful or otherwise, but it will be a speaking role with a part to play in the plot.\"\nOther lots up for grabs include an afternoon tea and book reading with David Walliams at Claridges and signed sketches of Radiohead at Glastonbury by author and illustrator Chris Riddell.\nA signed copy of Judith Kerr's A Tiger Who Came to Tea and a prop from the TV show Black Mirror are also on offer.\nBidding ends on 27 June.\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.
