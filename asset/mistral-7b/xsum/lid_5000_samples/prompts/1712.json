I just wish we could just go back to that day.\"\nIn a statement to the BBC, the Department of Health said there were currently no secure treatment units available for under 18s.\nThey said care for children with addiction problems is provided in line with NICE guidelines, which indicate self help as the first line of treatment and then formal cognitive behavioural therapy with family support.\nThey said there was not enough demand for a secure unit and the priority for the future would be strengthening existing provision in early intervention and intensive community based support, rather than on a specialist secure unit.\nThe health minister, Michelle O'Neill said she is trying to improve the response for those who are in crisis.\nSDLP MLA Nicola Mallon said she is dealing with cases similar to Aaron's in her own constituency, and said there is not enough support available.\nShe said when a child's mental health has deteriorated due to drug use there is no safe and secure space available to them.\n\"For children who really, really are in a bad place, they need somewhere they can go\", she told BBC News NI.\n\"It's not about locking a child up - it's about trying to put the child somewhere safe so that they can get all the help they need.\"\nSummary:\n",
