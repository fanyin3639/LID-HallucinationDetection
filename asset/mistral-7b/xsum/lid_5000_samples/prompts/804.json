I think we've ran a very positive campaign here and I'm proud of it.\"\nWhen asked whether she would still be the Labour candidate for Rochester and Strood in May 2015, she replied: \"I was selected here a year ago to fight an election in May 2015 and that's what I intend to do.\n\"I'm going to be out next year and I'm going to take from this election the things that I've learnt, the stories that I've heard from people, and they're the issues I'm going to continue to fight for.\"\nSummary:\n",
