The Conservatives were sitting on a majority of nearly 15,000 and, in the 1959 general election, the Liberals had trailed in third.\nBut he fought a tenacious campaign highlighting the perceived shortcomings of Harold Macmillan's government. \"We must not stop in our efforts to overthrow Tory blunder,\" he told his enthusiastic supporters.\nCracks began to appear in the Conservative campaign when their candidate Peter Goldman, who came from outside the seat, announced he had no intention of moving to live there if he became the MP.\nAt the same time the government announced a public-sector pay freeze that badly hit commuter areas like Orpington and impacted most severely on nurses, a move that was deemed highly unpopular.\nDespite this, few political analysts predicted anything other than a Conservative win and there was general astonishment when Lubbock overturned the 1959 result - leaving the Conservatives with a deficit of nearly 7,000.\nThe result helped hasten the end of the Macmillan government and raised hopes within the Liberal Party that were never in fact realised.\nDuring the next eight years, Lubbock earned a reputation in the House of Commons, not only for a conscientious devotion to the interests of his suburban constituents, but also by his tenacity in cases involving civil liberties and his grasp of technological affairs.\nFor good measure, he also served during most of this period as Liberal Chief Whip.\nLubbock held Orpington against fierce Conservative opposition at both the 1964 and 1966 general elections, but was defeated by the Conservative candidate in 1970.\n\"In 1962 the wise, far-seeing people of Orpington elected me as their Member,\" he said. \"In 1970 the fools threw me out.\"\nA year later he succeeded to the Avebury peerage on the death of his cousin, the third Baron; it seemed likely at first that he would renounce the title so as to contest Orpington again, but after consultation with the Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe he decided to accept his inheritance.\nBefore taking his seat in the House of Lords he visited Ceylon, now Sri Lanka, on behalf of Amnesty International to report on political detentions in the island.
