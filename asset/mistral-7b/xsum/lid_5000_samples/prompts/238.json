He was senior presiding judge there from 2006 to 2009 and now, as chairman of the Sentencing Council, is responsible for criminal sentencing policy in England and Wales.\nLord Justice Leveson is well known for being the barrister who led the prosecution case against serial killer Rose West, who was jailed in 1995 for the murder of 10 women and girls.\nHe was also the judge during the 2006 trial over the murder of 10-year-old London schoolboy Damilola Taylor.\nIn March, the Sun, a News International title, called him a \"softie\" for \"introducing proposals to let 4,000 assault convicts a year go free rather than face jail\".\n\"The inquiry must balance the desire for a robustly-free press with the rights of the individual, while at the same time, ensuring the critical relationships between the press, Parliament, the government and the police are maintained.\n\"The press provides an essential check on all aspects of public life. That is why any failure within the media affects us all. At the heart of this inquiry therefore may be one simple question: who guards the guardians? \"\nThe inquiry will make recommendations on:\nMs Chakrabarti said she was \"privileged\" to be on the panel and added: \"My acceptance is a vote of confidence in the vital role of independent judicial process in times of national difficulty.\n\"It comes from an optimism in the ability of a great democracy to look itself in the mirror in the spirit of rebuilding public trust.\n\"It reflects Liberty's belief in an appropriate balance between personal privacy and media freedom and above all in the rule of law.\"\nSummary:\n",
