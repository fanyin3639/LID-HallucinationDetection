They have the best CCTV available and they will look at all of the footage and anyone who threw anything will be banned for life.

Fans told me after the game how they and their children were pelted with coins.\nThe atmosphere turned toxic, with attention now focused not on the pitch but on events in the stand.\nA Chelsea fan broke through a line of stewards into the area dividing supporters, balancing on the tops of seats covered in claret tarpaulin. He goaded his rivals before retreating.\nThen the two sets of fans surged towards one another on the stadium concourse, which sits at the top of the lower section of the ground. It took a number of stewards, eventually backed up by riot police, to quell the standoff.\nThe final whistle came soon after and fans eventually left the stadium. But the damage by then had been done.\nI started watching football as a kid in the mid-1980s, when fan violence was rife within the game. The end of this match made it feel like I had momentarily stepped back in time.\nBBC Radio 5 live presenter Jonathan Overend, commentating on the game, said: \"This has been brewing all night.\n\"It's been hard to watch the match because of the flash points developing.
