He added that it appeared mass shootings were more frequent.\nThe Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said \"we are seeing these mass murders happen again and again and again\" and called on people in the US to \"get the political will to do everything we can to keep people safe\".\nUS gun violence in numbers - Shootings have become increasingly commonplace.\nWhat we know about Chris Harper Mercer - The alleged gunman reportedly supported the IRA.\nOregon shooting: The '4chan' thread - Did the gunman give a warning on the Internet?\nSuspect's father speaks out -  Ian Mercer says he is shocked and appealed for privacy.\nThe gunman was reportedly born in the UK and moved to the US as a young boy.\nA man identified as the gunman's father, Ian Mercer, told US media he was \"just as shocked as everybody\" by his son's actions.\nThe killer's motive is not known, although police said they were investigating reports that he had warned of his intentions on social media.\nLorie Andrews, who lives opposite the campus, said she heard what sounded like fireworks and when she came out of her home she saw students streaming out.\n\"One girl came out wrapped in a blanket with blood on her,\" she said.\nHannah Miles, 19, said that she and fellow students were led to a nearby bookshop, where they hid in a back room.\nThe 3,000-student school is located in Roseburg, Oregon, a rural area about 175 miles (280 km) south of Portland.\nHundreds of people gathered for a vigil in a Roseburg park on Thursday evening.\nIn audio from police radio channels an officer can be heard saying the suspect was down and that there were \"multiple gunshot wounds\", and calling for multiple ambulances to go the scene.\nThe suspect supposedly used a \"long gun\".\nAccording to Umpqua Community College's website, the average age of students is about 38.\nSummary:\n",
