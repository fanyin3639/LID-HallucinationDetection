    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nKris Boyd struck to put Killie ahead but Steven Lawless tucked away Thistle's deserved leveller before the half-time break.\nSoulemane Coulibaly headed in Dean Hawkshaw's cross for Kilmarnock's second but Liam Lindsay then equalised from close range.\nThe visitors finished with 10 men, Abdul Osman sent off for two bookings.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe visitors made a positive start and Lawless had a shot blocked by Lee Hendrie after David Amoo's goal-bound shot had been deflected wide by Jags team-mate Kris Doolan.\nKillie responded with Coulibaly trying to repeat his acrobatic effort against Dundee last week, the striker controlling Gary Dicker's chipped cross and hooking overhead to force a fine save from Ryan Scully.\nBoyd then showed all his striking instincts, reacting quickly after the ball looked liked running away from him to fire left-footed into the net.\nDoolan had a shot turned away by the boot of Killie keeper Jamie MacDonald but the leveller duly arrived as Lawless latched on to an Amoo cross and clipped the ball into the net.\nCoulibaly worked a neat one-two with Martin Smith before firing in a shot which Scully saved well and the goalkeeper then parried a free-kick by the striker.\nBut the Ivorian would eventually find the net, leaping high to meet Hawkshaw's cross from the right.\nIt was Coulibaly's sixth goal of the season.\nThistle were facing a fifth defeat in a row in all competitions but were determined to take something back to Glasgow.\nA free-kick on the right produced their equaliser as Callum Booth's delivery eluded everyone until central defender Lindsay blasted high into the net.\nThe drama did not end there as Thistle skipper Osman was sent off after a foul on Rory McKenzie resulted in a second booking for the midfielder.\nAnd though Thistle go level on points with Inverness, Partick's superior goal difference takes them up to 11th with Killie eighth.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nKilmarnock's Lee Clark: \"The key thing for us is we've got to start keeping some clean sheets because we're certainly a threat at the other end.\n\"It's frustrating. We need to stop conceding these silly goals and go on to win games.\n\"We certainly are (making progress), there's lots of positives to take. We're creating lots of opportunities, we have players in the attacking areas on form, we're proving very difficult for teams to beat.\"\nPartick Thistle's Alan Archibald: \"Going forward, we moved the ball really well but I was disappointed with our defending. Kilmarnock didn't have to work hard enough for their goals.\n\"It stops the rot after a bad run and a terrible performance last week.\"\nOn Osman's sending off: \"I think he has to be a bit more experienced. Once he is booked - you have to watch what you are doing.\n\"We became a bit stretched so it was probably a good foul at the time but we have lost him for next week.\"\nMatch ends, Kilmarnock 2, Partick Thistle 2.\nSecond Half ends, Kilmarnock 2, Partick Thistle 2.\nAttempt saved.
