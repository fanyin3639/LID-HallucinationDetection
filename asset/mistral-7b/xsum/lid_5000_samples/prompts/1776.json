If I had to repeat things I'd do it precisely the same.\"\nThe most high-profile fall-out came when Ferguson kicked a boot at former England midfielder Beckham during a dressing-room bust-up after an FA Cup defeat by Arsenal in 2003.\nIt left Beckham, 40, with an injury above his left eye and the former LA Galaxy player left for Real Madrid later that year. United went three years before winning the Premier League title again after his departure.\nFormer Republic of Ireland international midfielder Keane, 44, left Old Trafford in September 2005 after criticising team-mates in an interview for MUTV as Chelsea won the title that season.\nCentre-back Stam, 43, was sold to Lazio in August 2001 after writing in his autobiography that Ferguson \"tapped him up\" while the former Netherlands international was still at PSV Eindhoven. Ferguson said his decision to sell Stam was based purely on footballing matters.\nVan Nistelrooy and Ferguson fell out after the 39-year-old former Netherlands striker was on the bench for the Carling Cup final in 2006.
