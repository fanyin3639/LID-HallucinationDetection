    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nAn extremely divisive race.\nThe traditional centre-left and centre-right parties - which have governed Austria in one form or another since 1945 - were decimated during the first round.\nAnd the poll nearly, so very nearly resulted in a head of state from a right-wing populist party.\nThe rest of Europe watched and gawped.\nIs Europe lurching to the far right?\nEurope's nationalist surge, country by country\nTV debate turns to 'slugfest'\nCould this be a portentous sign of things to come elsewhere in Europe - Italy, France or Denmark for example, where right-wing populists are gaining in strength and influence?\nWas this Austria returning to its \"far-right\" past?\nJoerg Haider, who led Austria's Freedom Party until 2005, was well-known for his Nazi-praising comments.\nIn the end, the prospect of a Freedom Party president disturbed (just) enough Austrians to induce them to vote for the Green-Party-backed Independent candidate.\nBut are the now-defeated presidential hopeful, Norbert Hofer, and his Freedom Party actually 'far right'?\nNot even Austrians can agree, never mind the international media covering this story.\nFormer Austrian vice chancellor Hannes Androsch told me it was a nonsensical over-simplification - \"far too black and white\".\nThe Freedom Party has a far-right core that doesn't reflect the opinions of all its members, he told me, and, he insisted, is not at all representative of all its voters.\n\"They come to the Freedom Party out of protest. For a number of different reasons.\"\nOne large one is migration: Austria is struggling to integrate the tens of thousands of asylum seekers who moved here last year.\nOfficials say their country took in more refugees per capita than any other EU nation.\nPublic resentments have been heightened by rising unemployment.\n\"The Austrian boat is full,\" one Hofer voter told me. \"We're a small country. We can't be like [German Chancellor Angela] Merkel, saying: 'Come in, come in!'\n\"We have our own poor, Austrian poor, who need help.\"\n\"Austria First\" is the Freedom Party slogan. They describe themselves as a party of the centre, of the Austrian people, neither right nor left wing.\nThat's something Marine Le Pen of France likes to say about her National Front party too.\nAnd like the French National Front, the Freedom Party has invested in a makeover in order to appeal to discontented mainstream voters.\nDespite failing to make it to the presidential palace, it will interpret this vote as a huge success.\nOnce relegated to the far-right fringes, the Freedom Party is now deemed politically viable by half of all Austrian voters.\n\"This is far more a European problem than an Austrian problem, Austrian diplomat Wolfgang Petritsch told me. \"These parties have managed to make it OK, normal to vote for them. It's not a big deal anymore. And that is what is so dangerous.\"\nThe Freedom Party is now looking ahead to Austria's general election.\nIt is currently polling as the country's most popular party.\nConceding defeat today, Mr Hofer said his party would live to fight another day.\n\"Of course I am saddened,\" he said on Facebook. \"But please don't be disheartened.
