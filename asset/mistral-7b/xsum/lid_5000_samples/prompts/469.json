Most have residence permits, granted by the previous mayor.\nOn 24 May, according to the Ms Kapetanova, a group of Roma returned from selling mushrooms they had picked, and celebrated with loud music. When locals complained, a brawl developed, and there were attempts to set fire to the Roma shacks.\n\"Some Bulgarians in the village seemed well prepared,\" she says, speaking of those who attacked the Roma settlement. She suspects what she calls \"a hidden agenda\", but refuses to name names.\nKrassimir Kanev, head of the Bulgarian human rights group Helsinki Committee, accuses the Patriotic Front (PF) - an electoral alliance of two nationalist parties - of stoking hostility against the Roma, by turning a local quarrel into a nationwide scandal.\n\"This could turn into a violent conflict, and spoil inter-ethnic relations in Bulgaria,\" he said.\nInconclusive elections last October put a record eight parties into parliament.\nThe coalition government led by the centre-right GERB party depends on the votes of the nationalist PF alliance.\nLocal elections are due in October this year in Bulgaria, and the PF appears to want to prove to its supporters that it is active on two of its main policies - demolishing illegal Roma settlements, and preventing asylum-seekers entering Bulgaria.\nSummary:\n",
