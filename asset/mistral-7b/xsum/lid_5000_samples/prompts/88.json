The tip's movement is tracked, and results in a 3-D map at extraordinary resolution.\nThe team found that the sample from Oetzi contained structures with a tell-tale \"doughnut\" shape, just as red blood cells have.\nTo ensure the structures were preserved cells and not contamination of some kind, they confirmed the find using a laser-based technique called Raman spectroscopy - those results also indicated the presence of haemoglobin and the clot-associated protein fibrin.\nThat, Prof Zink explained, seems to solve one of the elements of the murder mystery.\n\"Because fibrin is present in fresh wounds and then degrades, the theory that Oetzi died some days after he had been injured by the arrow, as had once been mooted, can no longer be upheld,\" he said.\nThe team also suggest that their methods may prove to be of use in modern-day forensics studies, in which the exact age of blood samples is difficult to determine.\nSummary:\n",
