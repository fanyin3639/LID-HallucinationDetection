    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nNot only was it the culmination of 13 weeks of hard work from the finalists and their partners to deliver the fun, fireworks and fancy footwork that has made this year's Strictly the most-watched in its history.\nBut it was also the last time Len Goodman wielded his scoring paddle - the last time we'd hear his \"severrrrn!\" or \"it's a 10 from Len\" - in the dance series, having been head judge since it began back in 2004.\nEmotion was etched on the face of the professional dancers as they performed a ballroom tribute in his honour.\nThere wasn't a dry eye in the audience either, some of whom had been at Elstree Studios since 04:45 in a bid to get an elusive grand final seat.\nAnd there were tears too from the judges, with Bruno Tonioli overcome by Louise Redknapp's showdance to One Moment in Time.\nAs he told the singer, it encapsulated the \"joy of dance\".\nAnd that joy, as well as surprise, elation and stunned disbelief, were clear to see in Ore Oduba as his name was read out as the winner of Strictly 2016.\nGoodman had called him the \"spirit of Strictly\", thanks to his journey from being a complete beginner with no dance experience.\nAnd during the night, the atmosphere in the studio audience was electric as he performed his show dance, rising to their feet and stamping the floor in appreciation.\nBut part of that Strictly spirit is thanks to the show being one big family, as the contestants have repeatedly told me when I spoke to them throughout the series (not forgetting of course that two of the final professional dancers, Joanne and Kevin Clifton are actually siblings).\nThe Cliftons' parents were in the audience, with Joanne comforting her weeping mother after she lifted the glitterball trophy. Danny's proud family were also in the front row, as were Ore's beaming parents.\nLouise's husband, ex-footballer Jamie Redknapp and his father, former West Ham boss Harry, were also watching alongside other members of her family. Former Strictly contestants were in attendance, too, to show their support.\nThey all hugged each other at the start of the show, whispering words of encouragement to each other - with no hint that this was actually a competition.\nIt was that closeness, as well as the feeling of celebration with ticker tape and glitter floating in the air, that truly made this grand final the family party to end all parties.\nSummary:\n",
