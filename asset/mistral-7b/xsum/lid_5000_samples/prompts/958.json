    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nHe's been awarded an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in the Queen's New Year's Honours list for services to Drama.\nSpeaking to Greg James on Radio 1 he says: \"Turning it down doesn't really exist - you have to say if you'd accept it before it's offered.\n\"You get a letter that says you've been put forward for [an OBE] and if you were to be given it would you accept?\"\nJames says he thought about it a lot and discussed it with his wife because \"it's a weird thing\" and questioned whether he deserved it.\n\"You're painfully aware there are so many people who deserve it so much more,\" James tells Greg on Radio 1. \"Then you sort of think I went to Holmer Green Upper School in High Wycombe and I don't know how many of my year are getting letters like this.\n\"When I told my dad he said [the OBE] stands for other blokes' efforts.\n\"I'm honoured to accept it, I don't know if it's deserved or not. It will be a nice day to take my parents and thank them for the sacrifices they made for me to be able to do this as a job. It's lovely.\"\nJames is flying out to America today to start work on his new CBS show - The Late Late Show with James Corden.\nHe says: \"It's terrifying to think about it because I've no idea why I would be doing such a thing - I really don't. I came to the decision that I would rather regret doing something than regret not doing something.\n\"This is something I just have to go for and try my best to enjoy it.\n\"I'm not going with any expectation that I think it will work for the same reason that I thought I shouldn't accept the OBE at Christmas - I'm from High Wycombe and why should I be able to sit and talk to America every night?\n\"I just hope we can make a really fun, warm silly show.\"\nHosting the Late Late Show means that James can no longer be the frontman at the Brit Awards - which he's been since 2011.\nAnt and Dec will host the music awards next month with performances from Sam Smith, Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift.\nJames says he remembers feeling terrified: \"When I first took that show on it was in a place where it was almost unhostable. The very best people had done that show.\n\"I feel like the changes we made have allowed it to sit more as a TV show and Ant and Dec will be amazing.\nThey'll be far better than me - I've no doubt about that at all.\"\nFollow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube\nSummary:\n",
