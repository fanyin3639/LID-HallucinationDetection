    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nIt's not a disease or an illness, but a condition you're born with.\nPeople are affected in different ways.\nSome people don't need a lot of help but others might need special support all their lives.\nFor someone with autism everyday life can be confusing and chaotic.\nTheir brain works differently so just communicating with people is hard. Simple things like talking to other people, reading people's body language and expressions can be difficult.\nSome people will be able to speak normally while others won't be able to speak at all.\nThey might seem like they're not interested in people and find it hard to make friends and meet new people, preferring to spend time on their own.\nIt's sometimes difficult to tell people what they need, and how they feel. It's also hard to understand what other people think, and how they feel.\nIt can also make them over- or under-sensitive to sounds, touch, tastes, smells, light or colours.\nPeople who are unable to speak might use sign language to communicate.\nIt's quite common to want to repeat things, so doing the same things every day, playing the same games and so on. Some people become really attached to their routine and don't like to change it.\nThey might not take part in games or activities with other people as they find it hard to use their imagination or be creative.\nBut they can be really good at remembering things so might have a lot of knowledge about one particular subject. A lot of people with autism have the potential to do really well at school, college and later on at work.\nThey might have tantrums but it's not because they're naughty, they're just trying to express themselves and it can be frustrating that they can't do this.\nNearly three in every four children with autism feel unhappy or anxious about things. It's not because they're autistic, but because they're not getting the help and support they need.\nAnother form of autism is called Asperger syndrome. People with Asperger do not have learning difficulties but still find the same things difficult as people with autism.\nIt's hard to express themselves and how they feel. They're likely to want to make friends and socialise with people, but they find it very difficult.\nThey don't have as many problems with talking but might still find it difficult to understand language, so seeing how other people think and feel is hard.\nThere are over half a million people in Britain with autism, that's one in every 100 people. When you include those people's families, over two million British lives are affected by autism every day.\nNo one knows why people are born with autism but there's lots of research going on into what causes it. We know boys are more likely to have the condition than girls and it can run in families.\nThere's no cure, people who are born with autism have it all their lives. Only one in every six people with autism end up with a full time paid job when they're older but they can still do a lot of things and learn a lot of skills.\nSummary:\n",
