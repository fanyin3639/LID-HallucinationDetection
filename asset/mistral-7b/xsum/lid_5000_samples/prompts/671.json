In the local Amharic language, Arba Mintch means 40 springs - the name given to the town because of its many springs.\nFans of South Africa's football team, some of them wearing the famous hand-cut and hand-painted hard hats known as makarapa, have some anxious moments during Wednesday's match between Bafana Bafana and Nigeria's Super Eagles. The match ended in a goalless draw...\nOn Saturday, a Sierra Leone supporter reacts during the 2015 African Cup of Nations qualifying football match between Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone at the Felix Houphouet-Boigny stadium in Abidjan.  Disappointment awaited him as Ivory Coast won 2-1...\nAt the same match, an Ivorian fan holds a sign to raise public awareness about the deadly Ebola virus...\nWith Liberia worst-affected by the virus, a health worker on Tuesday disinfects a taxi which had transported an Ebola patient to a treatment centre in the capital, Monrovia. The World Health Organization (WHO) says that taxis are a common cause of transmission of Ebola.\nIn Kenya's capital Nairobi on Thursday, sex workers protest outside the offices of the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA). The women had gone to lodge a complaint with the watchdog body after a sex worker was alleged killed by a policeman...\nA day earlier, a prayer is held for three elderly Italian nuns who were killed at a convent in Burundi's capital, Bujumbura.  The Catholic diocese of Parma in Italy said the deaths appeared to have been \"the tragic outcome of an armed robbery by a mentally unbalanced person\".\nOn Sunday, at a qualifying African championship men's hockey match in Nairobi, a boy plays with a hockey ball during half-time. Kenya lost the game to Egypt 1-0.\nIn Rwanda's capital Kigali on the same say, a batsman shows his skills during a cricket match played at ETO Kicukiro, a former technical school where thousands of people  were killed during the 1994 genocide...\nOn Saturday, a white stork feasts on a cricket it caught on the pitch during the One Day International cricket final between South Africa and Australia in Zimbabwe's capital, Harare...\nThe next day, planes draw a heart in the sky at the largest air show to be held in Zimbabwe in more than 20 years. The show, on the outskirts of Harare, saw the participation of international aerobatics team and formation displays.\nWhile on Monday, a hadeda Ibis bird flies in front of the full moon rising over Johannesburg. It was the third and final \"super-moon\" of 2014.
