It could threaten the world if Pyongyang sells any of these weapons to Islamic militants or other extremists to secure hard cash.\"\nThere is no doubt that the attack has sent a tremor of fear through the defector community in South Korea.\nFugitives who were previously easy to contact have gone to ground. Thae Yong-ho, the diplomat who defected from the London embassy last year, already had bodyguards as he went incognito around Seoul but they would not have been able to protect him against a seemingly innocent member of the public just coming up and smearing him with a speck of VX.\nTwo years ago, the American ambassador in Seoul was lucky to survive when his face was slashed with a blade in public. How much easier it would be to kill someone with a mere trace of a chemical.\nThe great advantage of poisoning for the assassin is that it can be perfectly targeted and it kills with little immediate fuss. Only scientific examination afterwards reveals the cause.\nThose behind Kim Jong-nam's killing watched, then left.\nAlexander Litvinenko, a fugitive spy from Russia, took tea with two former KGB agents in London in 2006 and died three weeks later of poisoning by radioactive polonium-210, believed to have been administered in the cup.\nThe BBC producer, Georgi Markov, was murdered at a bus stop in central London in 1978 but his killer vanished in the crowd seconds after the victim felt the pin-prick from an umbrella used like a syringe to inject the fatal poison. He had been a thorn in the side of the Bulgarian communist government but so simple and bloodless was the killing that nobody was ever identified as the perpetrator.\nThe efficiency of poison as a means of assassination is leading North Korea watchers in South Korea to think that there was no great intention to send a signal by using VX specifically.\nKoh Yu-hwan, of Dongguk University, thinks that VX was chosen because of its efficiency; North Korea - or at least leader Kim Jong-un - allegedly wanted Kim Jong-nam dead and VX offered certainty.\nIt also offered the possibility that the death would pass as being from natural causes, at least for the time before a serious post-mortem scientific examination could take place.\nChang Yong-seok, of Seoul National University's Institute for Peace and Unification Studies, adds: \"North Korea was already under immense pressure over its efforts to develop nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles, and also its human rights issues.
