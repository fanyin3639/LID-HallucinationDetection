The requests are believed to have been flagged because they were to private accounts rather than other banks and because there were so many of them.\nThe money that the hackers did steal ended up in accounts in Sri Lanka and the Philippines.\nPart of the money was recovered from Sri Lanka, but the rest was laundered through casinos in the Philippines. The central bank said it was working with authorities there to recover the remaining amount.\nBangladesh's government has publicly blamed the New York Fed for not spotting the suspicious transactions earlier.\nSummary:\n",
