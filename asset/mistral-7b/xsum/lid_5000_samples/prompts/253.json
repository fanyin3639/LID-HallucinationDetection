    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nChasing a revised 327 from 47 overs, the hosts crumbled from 53-1 to 84 all out, suffering their heaviest runs defeat in List A cricket.\nEngland seamer David Willey took 3-44 and Kyle Carver 3-5 as Yorkshire recorded their biggest victory.\nOpener Adam Lyth's 92-ball 136 set the platform for Yorkshire's 325-7.\nLyth, capped seven times by England at Test level but never in white-ball cricket, struck seven sixes and 12 fours as he posted a career-best List A score for the second time in less than 24 hours.\nHaving improved on the 125 he made in Tuesday's One-Day Cup win against Northants, he became the first Yorkshire batsman to score two List A hundreds in successive days.\nKane Williamson (40) and Gary Ballance (34) chipped in with useful contributions as Yorkshire compiled what looked to be a competitive total at the midway stage - but few could have predicted the collapse that was to follow.\nLancashire's reply got off to a promising start, with New Zealand batsman Martin Guptill clobbering Willey for successive maximums on his way to 45 from 24 deliveries.\nBut the 26-year-old former Northants all-rounder came back to bowl Guptill with his next ball, a dismissal that sparked a spectacular collapse.\nWilley, Carver, Tim Bresnan (2-22) and Adil Rashid (2-10) ripped through the Lancashire order and no other batsman was able to reach double figures, meaning Guptill's score would make up more than half of his team's total.\nLancashire, who currently sit top of the County Championship, were dismissed in only 17.3 overs.\nLancashire's 242-run hammering was their worst runs defeat in this format of the game, surpassing the 171-run loss suffered to Middlesex at Lord's in 1984.\nTheir total of 84 at Old Trafford was also their 10th lowest, and their third lowest against rivals Yorkshire.\nThe White Rose bettered their previous biggest runs victory, set in 1996 when they beat Nottinghamshire by 205 runs at Headingley.\nLancashire director of cricket and head coach Ashley Giles told BBC Radio Manchester:\n\"It was poor cricket from start to finish - with bat, ball, in the field and from a coaching perspective. If you lose like that, we all have to be accountable for it.\n\"There are no excuses. We played bad cricket. They got too many runs. Lyth played well, but we didn't bowl enough balls in the right place.\n\"Not to get anywhere near and in the manner we got out, you have to show more application and play better shots. From start to finish, it was not good enough.\"\nYorkshire captain Alex Lees:\n\"We're delighted with the performance. In particular, Adam Lyth's been outstanding in the last two one-day innings. They've been the match-winning innings we've needed. And the lads have batted well around him.\n\"Bowling wise we were probably a bit more savvy than Lancs to start with. We made sure they had lots of mix-ups.\n\"But, when you get over 300 in this format, you've only got to bowl a few decent overs for that rate to climb. The seamers bowled brilliantly and Adil and Karl saw us home at the end.\"\nSummary:\n",
