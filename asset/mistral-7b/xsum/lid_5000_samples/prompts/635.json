    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nThe BBC wants a copyright tribunal to resolve the row with collection agency Eos after its members broke away from the Performing Right Society (PRS).\nEos claimed they were being short-changed and the group has accused the BBC of conducting \"sham\" negotiations.\nMr Davies says he wants an agreement, and the row could not go on endlessly.\nMr Davies said: \"There is goodwill and I would rather come to an agreement without having to go to a tribunal hearing and that's what we're working towards.\"\nA tribunal will ensure all the arguments are heard and that a \"fair and transparent\" agreement is reached if the two sides cannot find a solution, he said.\n\"It's not a threat,\" he told Radio Cymru's Post Cyntaf programme.\n\"The tribunal is an institution for solving this kind of dispute so if we can't come to a settlement through negotiation then this is where this kind of dispute goes.\"\nHe added: \"I want to avoid going to law. I want to reach an agreement on this without having to go to a tribunal, but we cannot allow this dispute to continue endlessly.\"\nTalks between Eos and the BBC have been underway for months, but they failed to reach an agreement 1 January when Eos officially took control of the rights of its members' music.\nAs a result, more than 300 composers and publishers withdrew the right to play their music on the BBC, denying Radio Cymru rights to play about 30,000 songs.\nMr Davies said there was a \"significant gap\" between what Eos was seeking and what the BBC was offering.\nThe BBC has offered to contribute to the group's legal costs.\nHowever, its chief executive, Dafydd Roberts, said the latest development was \"disappointing\".\n\"It appears that the discussions were a sham and in the meantime the BBC has been preparing documents and evidence for the tribunal,\" he said.\nMr Roberts has said that Eos will consider allowing Radio Cymru to play its members' music while the royalties dispute is sorted out.\nSummary:\n",
