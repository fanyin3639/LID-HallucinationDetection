It is highly unusual for select committees to have to resort to issuing a summons.\"\nThe businessman has refused to attend the meetings in the past and at one stage said the MPs involved were \"a joke\".\nHe had been warned he could be in contempt of Parliament if he continued to refuse to appear at Westminster.\nNewcastle United owner Mr Ashley has yet to comment on the committee's refusal.\nAshley was asked to attend the meeting on the back of a BBC investigation into working practices at Sports Direct's warehouse, based in Shirebrook.\nA spokesman for Sports Direct said: \"We are disappointed that members of the committee have chosen not to visit Shirebrook in order to see working conditions with their own eyes, as we continue to believe that this is obviously the best way forward.\n\"The committee are well aware that Mike Ashley's proposal to attend Westminster on 7 June was made on the understanding that MPs would visit Shirebrook on any day in advance of 6 June.\n\"The committee are clearly being unfair, Mike will therefore now seek legal advice with regard to his position in relation to 7 June.\"\nSummary:\n",
