It's a disappointing end to the 12 months for Jonny, both at club and international level.\"\nMay's absence is a further blow for new England head coach Eddie Jones, with Bath forward Dave Attwood and Leicester lock Ed Slater ruled out of next month's championship earlier this week.\nNorthampton prop Kieran Brookes is also set for an extended spell on the sidelines after having an operation on his knee, as is Exeter centre Henry Slade and back row Dave Ewers.\nEngland start their Six Nations campaign under Jones against Scotland on 6 February.\nAnthony Watson and Jack Nowell featured in the World Cup and may be the likely starters at Murrayfield, while Chris Ashton and Semesa Rokoduguni are pushing for places in the squad.\nHumphreys hopes to have May back for the start of next season, with the winger likely to also miss England's summer tour of Australia.\n\"He was very quick to text me after the operation to tell me he plans to come back fitter and stronger,\" added Humphreys.\n\"Jonny has shown in the past when he has been injured that he will work hard and I have no doubt we will see him back performing and shining in Gloucester colours.\"\nSummary:\n",
