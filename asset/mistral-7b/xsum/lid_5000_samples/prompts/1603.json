It is absolutely amazing. It gives the pier a sustainable future - we're marking history.\n\"For at least the next 40 to 50 years there is a plan in place to keep the pier upright.\n\"Once the work is done, that will buy us eight to 10 years before major work has to start again.\"\nThe cost of the scheme was originally estimated at \u00a31.7m but more detailed surveys put the cost at \u00a32.2m.\nThe project will involve replacing pieces of the 120-year-old timber and turning Marine Villas, which predates the main pier structure by 70 years, into a new visitor centre.\nThere has been a pier at Swanage since 1859 but the current pier was opened in 1897.\nIt was acquired by the Swanage Pier Trust in 1994 and renovations have so far cost more than \u00a31.1m.\nIn 2013, one of the pier's piles was severely damaged in a storm and cost \u00a350,000 to replace.\nThe latest project has already received \u00a3893,800 in Heritage Lottery Funding.\nSummary:\n",
