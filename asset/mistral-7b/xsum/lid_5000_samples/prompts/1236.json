Several other counties have lobbied for a floodlit Test but Warwickshire - who staged the first floodlit one-day match against Somerset in 1997 - have been in the vanguard of night cricket for years. Permanent lights were installed at Edgbaston in 2011, 11 years after the ground staged its first floodlit one-day international against Zimbabwe.\n\"It will be Edgbaston's 50th Test - the scene of just eight defeats and 26 victories for England. It will be an invaluable learning process for the home side, with at least one [day-night] Ashes Test due a few months later in Australia.\n\"A three-day second XI match against Worcestershire was trialled under lights in September, with both the Duke and Kookaburra ball being used. The experiment was deemed a success, which led to the ECB's blessing for Edgbaston.\n\"More tickets have been sold for Edgbaston international matches than any other ground outside London in the past decade, and with West Indies hardly a major attraction these days the attendance is unlikely to be lower than if it were a daytime Test. The novelty factor and appeal to workers in the city centre - just a mile away - is likely to impact favourably on the gate.\"\nSummary:\n",
