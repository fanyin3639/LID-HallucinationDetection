    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nThe phenomenon happens when the moon passes between the Sun and Earth.\nThe sun is roughly 400 times larger than the moon and also 400 times further away from Earth, but when they pass each other to create the eclipse, they appear the same size to us.\nWhile the eclipse will be most visible in the Arctic and northern Europe, with the best view in the Faroe Islands and Svalbard, the spectacle we have in Wales will depend on the amount of cloud in the sky.\nSome high cloud is expected Friday morning, but this should be fairly thin.\nThere will be some good breaks in the cloud during the morning and clear spells with spring sunshine, especially further south.\nPeople are being warned about the dangers of looking directly at the Sun.\nCARDIFF: Starts: 08:22:38  Maximum: 09:27:55  Finishes: 10:37:20. Eclipse magnitude will be 0.88\nABERYSTWYTH: Starts: 08:23:38  Maximum: 09:28:38  Finishes: 10:37:41.
