    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nAlmost all focus on the fact that the Republic of Ireland is set to have a half-Indian, openly gay prime minister.\nMr Varadkar has come to embody the liberalisation of a country which was once regarded as one of the most socially conservative in Europe.\nBut, in Ireland, Mr Varadkar's sexuality and ethnic background have not been particularly prominent.\nHe has won the race for the leadership of Fine Gael - the biggest party in the country's ruling coalition - meaning he is in line to take over as taoiseach (Irish prime minister) in the next few weeks.\nThe leadership contest focused primarily on socio-economic issues and the defining challenges for Mr Varadkar will be how to build on the Republic of Ireland's recovery from the financial disaster of several years ago, and how to manage Brexit.\nMr Varadkar was born on 18 January 1979 in Dublin.\nHis father Ashok - a doctor from Mumbai - met his mother Miriam, an Irish nurse, while they were both working in Slough in Berkshire.\nThey settled in Ireland in the 1970s.\nThe country Mr Varadkar grew up in was very different to today.\nUntil the 1990s, homosexuality and divorce were illegal.\nThere were few immigrants, and the Republic of Ireland was one of the poorer members of the EU.\nMr Varadkar followed his father into medicine.\nHe became a councillor aged 24 and, in 2007, he was elected to the Irish parliament, D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.\nThe so-called Celtic Tiger was a global phenomenon - low corporate tax rates brought massive investment to the Republic of Ireland, which became one of the richest countries in the world.\nBut the economy crashed amidst the worldwide financial crisis - and Ireland had to accept a \u00a371bn international bailout.\nIn the aftermath, Fine Gael came to power at the head of a coalition in 2011.\nMr Varadkar was appointed minister for transport, tourism and sport - and then health minister.\nMore recently he has run Ireland's welfare system.\nHe has built up a high media profile - descriptions of him as a \"sharp-shooter\" and \"straight-talker\" are common.\nIn 2015, he came out as gay in an interview with the Irish national broadcaster, RT\u00c9.\nHe said: \"It's not a big deal for me any more. I hope it's not a big deal for anyone else - it shouldn't be.\"\nA few months later, Ireland voted in a referendum to legalise same-sex marriage.\nWhen Enda Kenny announced his retirement as taoiseach and Fine Gael leader, Mr Varadkar's supporters launched a \"shock-and-awe\" strategy which saw most of the party's parliamentarians endorse him within 48 hours.\nHis opponent, Housing Minister Simon Coveney, was never able to recover.\nBut he did express \"deep concern\" at the direction in which his rival would take Fine Gael - suggesting Mr Varadkar's economic policies would pull the party to the right.\nMr Varadkar said Fine Gael should represent those \"who got up early in the morning\".\nHe went on to say he was talking about \"people working in the public and private sector, the self-employed, carers getting up to mind loved ones, parents getting up to mind children\".\nBut Fine Gael's political enemies have tried to portray him as a rightwing ideologue - pointing to a recent campaign against benefits cheats.\nMr Varadkar's predecessor, Mr Kenny, stood down a year after an election result in which Fine Gael lost seats, and could only form a minority government.\nWhen Mr Varadkar is officially installed as premier in the next few weeks he will be, at 38, the country's youngest prime minister.\nHe will face what Mr Kenny has described as the biggest challenge the Irish state has ever had - the departure of its nearest neighbour from the EU.\nBut Mr Varadkar has an internationalist outlook - seeing himself in the same mould as the French President Emmanuel Macron or the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - a youthful, dynamic, centrist leader.\nHis potent political brand has taken him far- but his toughest tests are still to come.\nSummary:\n",
