    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nThe Supreme Court ruled that oil and gas exploration near the community of Clyde River cannot go ahead.\nThe unanimous decision stated Canada failed in its duty to consult the tiny Inuit hamlet about the impact of seismic testing near their community.\nThe court heard the case in November.\nWednesday's decision helps clarify the federal government's duty to consult with indigenous groups on development projects.\nJerry Natanine, former mayor of Clyde River, said on Wednesday he is grateful for the outcome of the \"seemingly impossible case\".\n\"Justice is on our side. We're fighting for our life, our way of life.\"\nThe legal fight dates back to 2014, when three energy companies received authorisation from the National Energy Board (NEB), a regulatory agency, to undertake a five-year offshore seismic survey for oil and gas under the ocean around Baffin Island.\nThe northern community of under 1,000 people relies heavily on hunting and fishing for both food and trade. They also had established treaty rights to hunt and harvest marine mammals in the area.\nThe community was concerned the seismic testing, which uses loud noises, would harm the marine life they depend on, a worry confirmed by the NEB.\nThe agency's environmental assessment concluded the project could indeed endanger marine mammals and change their migration routes.\nTheir campaign caught the attention of celebrities Leonardo DiCaprio, Emma Thompson, Jane Fonda, and Oprah Winfrey.\nGreenpeace Canada also championed the cause, including funding some of the legal fees.\nIn the Clyde River ruling, Canada's highest court found that while Ottawa holds ultimate responsibility for ensuring that consultations with indigenous communities are adequate, it can rely on the NEB's process to fulfill that for energy-related projects.\nBut it found that the NEB's process fell short in this case.\nWhile NEB held consultations with the communities, the court noted that residents \"asked  basic questions about the effects of the survey on marine mammals in the region, but the proponents were unable to answer many of them\".\nIt also noted documentation was difficult to download due to the size of the files and that only a fraction was translated into Inuktitut, the local language.\nMr Natanine said that Clyde River residents are not opposed to development but want a frank discussion and negotiation on the dangers and compensation.\nThe Clyde River case was heard alongside that of the Chippewas of the Thames First Nation.\nThe  community in southwest Ontario took legal action over Enbridge's Line 9 pipeline, saying the Canadian government failed to properly consult with them over the plans to reverse the flow in an existing pipeline and expand its capacity.\nIn that case, the Supreme Court ruled that the community was adequately consulted on Enbridge's plans.\nSummary:\n",
