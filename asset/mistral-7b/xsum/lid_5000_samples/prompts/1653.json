    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSeven-time champion Federer won 6-4 6-2 6-2 on Centre Court to reach the fourth round, where he will face Steve Johnson or Grigor Dimitrov.\nTara Moore earlier lost 6-1 2-6 6-3 to Russia's Svetlana Kuznetsova - the last Briton to fall in the women's singles.\nMurray will play Australian John Millman in round three on Saturday.\nFederer had already seen off one British hopeful in Marcus Willis in the second round and the world number three worked quickly to dispatch Evans, who was looking to reach the last 16 for the first time.\nThe Swiss went 4-0 up in the first set, and although Evans snatched a break back, Federer managed to see it out.\nIt was a similar story in the second set as Evans fell four games behind again and was unable to recover.\nThe British number four held his serve in the opening game of the third set, but from there Federer won three games to love and Evans found no way back.\n\"It was good,\" said Evans. \"A bit surreal actually seeing him down the other end. Yeah, it was tough to just get used to.  I mean, so many people.\n\"It was very different to what I am used to. I didn't expect it to be so sort of on top of me.  It was pretty, like, close.  It was really close.\n\"It was just an amazing experience just to play him. I don't think I played too bad, I just didn't serve very well. I enjoyed it.\"\nWildcard Moore belied her ranking of 227 on court three, but was the last of six British women to go out of the singles.\nMoore, 23, had never faced a top-20 player before but was a match for Kuznetsova after working her way into the second-round contest.\n\"I've given my all,\" she said. \"Maybe I didn't play the greatest of tennis, but she definitely played some very good tennis, and she showed everyone why she is where she is.\"\nThe Briton could not cope with the pace in the early stages, falling 4-0 behind as the 31-year-old Russian swept through the first set either side of a rain delay.\nDespite her struggles, Moore was able to smile as she came out for the second set with chants of \"Tara! Tara!\" ringing around the court.\nIt clearly had a galvanising effect as she began to get a foothold in the rallies, breaking serve three times and firing 16 winners as she levelled at one set all.\nMoore, roared on by the crowd, recovered an early break in the decider to trail 4-3 but sent a forehand long to drop serve again, and Kuznetsova closed out the win.\n\"I can't describe that feeling when someone is screaming your name,\" added  Moore. \"They're great. I just adore them so much. They're lovely.\"\nSubscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.\nSummary:\n",
