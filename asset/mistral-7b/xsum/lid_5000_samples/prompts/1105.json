    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nThis is the Hermione, faithful replica of the original French ship of that name, and the fruit of 20 years' devotion, ingenuity and sheer hard graft.\nThe three-master has successfully passed sea trials in the Bay of Biscay and is now to embark on its maiden voyage: a transatlantic crossing to where its namesake once roved with the Americans.\nManning the ship is a crew of 18 professional sailors and 54 young volunteers, some of whom have never been at sea before. They have six weeks of wind and volatile weather ahead of them, before their next sighting of land.\nSymbolically that will be at Yorktown at the opening of Chesapeake Bay - the scene in 1781 of England's final surrender to George Washington at the end of the American Revolution.\nYorktown was the result of an American-French alliance that - for all the subsequent travails in the relationship - still counts for much in the two nations' historical memory.\nAnd the Hermione has its own important part in the story.\nFor it was the Hermione that in 1780 carried to Boston a young French aristocrat - Gilbert du Motier the Marquis de Lafayette - who more than 200 years later still wears the mantle of America's BFF: Best French Friend. Ever.\nTall ships, history, and Franco-US friendship: devotees saw in the Hermione project a chance to celebrate all three.\n\"The sad truth is that even though France is a great maritime nation, we have rather neglected our naval memory,\" says historian Laurence Chatel de Brancion, who has written a biography of Lafayette.\n\"There was no French equivalent of the Victory (Nelson's flagship) which did us so much damage at Trafalgar! We needed to have our own historic ship which people can visit in order to learn about our naval past.\"\nThe Hermione was chosen partly because of the Lafayette connection (which certainly helped in getting funds from US donors), but also because the frigate represented a highpoint in French shipbuilding.\nCompleted in 1779 at the port of Rochefort, the Hermione (the French pronounce it  Air-mee-on) was the pride of the French navy. She was small (216ft [65m] and 34 guns) but she was sleek and very fast.\nThe English, who had been fighting the French for the previous century and would continue doing so till 1815, were certainly impressed.\nIn 1783 they captured the Hermione's sister ship, the Concorde. Before putting her back to war under the Union Jack, they conducted a thorough study - to work out how she sailed so briskly.\nThose plans were kept at naval headquarters in Greenwich - and two centuries later formed the basis for the Hermione recreation!\nAfter several years of initial fund-raising by the Hermione-Lafayette Association, building of the replica got under way in 1997.\nOver the years hundreds of thousands of people visited the renovated shipyard at Rochefort to see the work in progress.  In the end it took 17 years and \u20ac26m ($30m)  in public and private money.\nOn the dockside at La Rochelle - beneath a blistering early spring sun - she certainly looks a gem.  A long line of visitors is being ushered around the top deck for a viewing, but all around crew members are frantically completing preparations for Saturday's departure.\nSome are high in the rigging - others are practising knot-tying, unloading stores and adding last touches of paint.\nBack in 1780 the original Hermione was chosen for Lafayette's mission because of its speed.\nIt was the nobleman's second trip to the fledgling United States. He had already met George Washington and been utterly seduced by him.\nIn fact Ben Franklyn (the rebellious colonies' point man in Paris) had expressly urged Washington to flatter the Frenchman, keep him alive and then send him back to court in Versailles where his advocacy could help procure the vital French alliance.\nIt all went perfectly to plan and on this second trip Lafayette was conveying to Washington the promise of real material help: soldiers and ships.\nToday Lafayette is remembered in dozens of place names across the United States (such as La Fayette Alabama and Fayetteville North Carolina).\nSome of these towns were named after Lafayette's barnstorming tour of the United States in 1824-5, where he was celebrated as the last surviving general of the war of independence.\nBut in France he had mixed fortunes. In the revolution he managed to irritate the royalists by being too liberal and the revolutionaries by being too conservative.\nFor Chatel de Brancion, Lafayette was \"strong on courage, hopeless at politics\".  But he was certainly a survivor, and served successive French governments until his death in 1834.\nThe rebuilt Hermione is identical in all but certain modern particularities to the ship that Lafayette would have known.\nToday's rules require an engine and lifeboats. And hygiene standards are no doubt considerably higher than 240 years ago.\nBut below decks they have managed to cram in sleeping space for 70 (hammocks of course) plus kitchens, showers, storage areas, captain's cabin, sail-room, engine room and other facilities.\nAmong the volunteers in red T-shirts is one young man who would not have been out of place next to the marquis.\nThis is Adam Hodges-Leclair, an American student and clothing specialist, who has made and wears his own 18th Century sailor's outfit.\n\"The experience allows me to see how the clothes work in practice.
