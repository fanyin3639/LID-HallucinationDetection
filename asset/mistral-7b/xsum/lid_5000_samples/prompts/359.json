    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nFor the US, this highly secret operation, conducted without informing the Pakistan government, was both payback and a form of closure for the 9/11 attacks of 2001.\nFor Pakistan, it was both a national insult and an embarrassment.\nBin Laden, or \"OBL\" as he became known in the West, had been discovered living comfortably just 31 miles (50km) from the capital, Islamabad, and almost under the nose of Pakistan's Military Academy in Abbottabad.\nBut five years on from that dawn raid, later dramatised by Hollywood in the film Zero Dark Thirty, violent jihadism is still very much a global phenomenon.\nThe last 12 months have seen jihadist attacks on almost every continent - in Europe, America, the Middle East, South East Asia and Africa.\nSo how much of this is Osama Bin Laden's legacy and what will be his lasting impact, if any, on the world?\nHow the lives of Osama Bin Laden's neighbours changed forever\nBin Laden: The long hunt for the al-Qaeda leader\nWas killing legal?\nWas Bin Laden still in charge of al-Qaeda?\nIn pictures: Osama Bin Laden's life\nBin Laden files: Seven things we learned\n\"Bin Laden's death did leave a legacy,\" says Dr Sajjan Gohel, of the Asia Pacific Foundation, \"but to some extent, it has been usurped by Isis (so-called Islamic State, also known as IS) who have taken over and built on his goals for creating a transnational terrorist project\".\nTo many people, the 22-year-long era of Bin Laden's al-Qaeda from 1989 to 2011 might not seem that different from the violent ideology of today's IS.\nBoth groups have espoused a narrow-minded, intolerant version of the Islamic religion, casting anyone - even other Sunni Muslims - as apostates if they do not share their world view.\nThey both use suicide bombings and mass murder of civilians as tactics and they both reject the concept of democracy as being incompatible with Sharia, Islamic law.\nYet they are different and if OBL - or Abu Abdullah as he was known to his followers - were alive today he would almost certainly have disapproved of the actions and timing of IS.\nBin Laden's strategy was a patient, long-term, generational one. He was hoping that 9/11 and other spectacular attacks would so demoralise the US and the West that they would abandon their support for secular Arab regimes in the Middle East, paving the way for an eventual takeover by jihadists and the creation of an Islamic caliphate.\nHe saw this as being perhaps decades away and probably not in his natural lifetime.\nEven before his death, there were indications that OBL and the al-Qaeda leadership in Pakistan disagreed with the extreme violence being employed by al-Qaeda's Iraqi franchise which went on to become the modern-day IS.\nObituary: Osama Bin Laden\n\"IS has gone in different directions from Bin Laden's al-Qaeda,\" says Dr Gohel.\n\"It deliberately kills Sunni Muslims, including women and children. (IS has carried out several mosque bombings in Saudi Arabia, killing Sunni and Shia alike).\n\"It also engages in criminal activity, human trafficking and is open to recruiting women, all of which al-Qaeda was opposed to.\"\nYears from now, historians will most likely conclude that the death of Osama Bin Laden in that pre-dawn US raid on 2 May 2011 dealt a near-fatal blow to the organisation he came to represent.\nHis successor, Dr Ayman Al-Zawahiri, is a dull, bespectacled Egyptian ideologue devoid of charisma.\nHis long, wordy speeches are in marked contrast to the snappy use of social media and the internet by today's generation of IS operatives.\nThe controversial CIA-run programme of drone strikes in Pakistan's Tribal Territories has kept what is left of Bin Laden's organisation constantly looking over its shoulders, inhibiting its ability to plan a repeat of the London bombings.\nAl-Qaeda's regional franchises, like Al-Shabaab in Somalia and AQAP in Yemen, have largely been left to develop by themselves.\nRichard Clarke, who was President George W Bush's counter-terrorism chief until 2003, believes that regardless of what followed, the death of Bin Laden marked a watershed.\n\"I think there was a propaganda effect right away,\" he says.\n\"As long as he was alive, the Americans looked impotent but the longer term effect (of his death) was that al-Qaeda Central, their headquarters, never really recovered. Al-Qaeda as a multinational organisation doesn't really exist.\"\nYet without such a single, identifiable target as OBL, today's IS presents a more diffuse and difficult target for the US to hit.\nIts leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, rarely surfaces and IS will have anyway planned long ago for his demise.\nIn recent days, the US presidential hopeful Donald Trump has vowed to destroy IS, without saying how.\nBut as the global effort grinds on to defeat or at least contain violent Islamic extremism, the absence of such a charismatic figure as OBL was to his followers makes it unlikely that such a decisive one-off moment as his death five years ago will ever be repeated.\nSummary:\n",
