    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nCraig Stewart, 32, from Devon, was treated at hospitals in England but had no movement in his left arm.\nAfter three years of treatment at Morriston Hospital, he can move his previously paralysed arm.\nSurgeons from the Welsh centre for burns and plastic surgery have spent 12 years developing pioneering treatment.\nFollowing the accident, which happened soon after he left the Army, Mr Stewart was treated at hospitals in Devon and London.\n\"My arm was just like a dead weight. I had no control over it. It would just hang down by my side,\" he said.\nMr Stewart was then referred to specialist consultant plastic surgeon Dean Boyce in Morriston, who took muscle from his thigh to act as a bicep.\nAfter a further year of physiotherapy and hydrotherapy, he was able to bend his arm.\nTwo months ago, a tendon was switched from his wrist to his hand, allowing him to have limited movement in his fingers.\nThe fork lift driver said: \"It happened and I had to live with it. But starting to get everything working again is great - it's a bonus.\"\nMorriston is one of the few places in the UK that can treat injuries to the brachial plexus - the network of nerves in the neck that control upper limb movement.\nMr Boyce called it \"a very complex area of surgery\".\nSummary:\n",
