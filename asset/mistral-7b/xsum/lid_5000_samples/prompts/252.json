    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nA decision on whether to press ahead with building four new submarines for the seaborne deterrent, expected to cost \u00a331bn, will be taken next year.\nThe SNP, who have secured a Commons debate, said Trident was a \"political ego trip\" which would never be used.\nBut Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Trident was part of an \"array of weapons\" that the UK needed to have.\nHe told MPs it was worrying that the long-established cross-party consensus about the necessity of having a continuous-at-sea nuclear weapons capability was \"weakening\", saying the existing posture \"worked\".\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn opposes Trident renewal but many of his MPs disagree with him and Labour has dismissed Tuesday's debate as a stunt.\nThe \"maingate\" decision on whether to order four new Vanguard submarines, to replace the existing fleet, will be taken in 2016.\nThe government revealed on Monday that the total cost of renewing Trident has risen by \u00a36bn to \u00a331bn and the start date for the replacement submarines had been put back until \"the early 2030s\".\nThe SNP want the submarines, which are currently based at Faslane naval base on the Clyde, removed from Scottish soil. They have criticised the \"ballooning\" cost of Trident, saying it could consume up to 50% of the UK's total military procurement budget.\n\"Trident is not a military weapon, Trident is a political weapon,\" Brendan O'Hara, the party's defence spokesman told MPs. \"And it is a political weapon that can never and will never be used.\"\n\"Money that should be doing good, whether on peacekeeping, reacting to emergencies or alleviating the humanitarian crisis currently unfolding in front of us in the Middle East is being sacrificed on a combined military and political ego trip.\"\nBut Mr Fallon defend the cost, saying spread out over 35 years - the lifetime of the successor submarines - it amounted to 0.2% of total government spending per year and would provide an \"insurance policy\" for the UK's defences up to 2060.\n\"Our allies and adversaries will be paying attention (to the debate),\" he said. \"It is not a time to gamble with our security.\"\nOfficial Labour policy remains to renew Trident, but party leader Jeremy Corbyn is firmly opposed and a review is taking place to consider the party's stance. Labour MPs are being asked to abstain in the vote - but as many as 20 are thought to be prepared to rebel and vote for Trident to be renewed.\nShadow defence secretary Maria Eagle is not among the few Labour MPs present in the chamber for the debate while many of the 15 or so that are, including John Woodcock,  who represents Barrow-in-Furness, where the submarines are built, Jamie Reid and Angela Smith, have made the case for renewal.\nSpeaking officially for the opposition, shadow defence minister Toby Perkins accused the SNP of trying to score \"cheap political points\" by highlighting \"perceived\" Labour splits on the issue, rather than engaging is serious debate.\n\u00a331bn\nIn case costs overrun, the government will also set aside \u00a310bn\nPrevious estimates put the cost at up to \u00a325bn\nInsisting that Labour's review - to be co-chaired by Ms Eagle and former London Mayor Ken Livingstone - would come up with an agreed position that the party could unite behind, he insisted: \"We will not play political games with an issue as important as this.\"\nAhead of Tuesday's debate, former Labour Defence Secretary Lord Browne warned Trident could be rendered obsolete by cyber attacks.\nLord Browne, who held the job between 2006 and 2008, told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that ministers had an \"obligation\" to assure MPs all parts of the nuclear deterrent had been assessed against the risk of a cyber attack and that protections were in place.\nHe said: \"If they are unable to do that then there is no guarantee that we will have a reliable deterrent or the prime minister will be able to use this system when he needs to reach for it.\"\nThe strategic defence review published on Monday committed the government to a debate on the future of Trident but not a vote on the main renewal decision. However, Mr Cameron said he was \"keen\" to hold a non-binding vote \"at the appropriate moment\".\nThe government has said the revised cost - including a \u00a310bn contingency - and timescale of the project reflected the \"greater understanding we now have about the detailed design of the submarines and their manufacture\".\nSummary:\n",
