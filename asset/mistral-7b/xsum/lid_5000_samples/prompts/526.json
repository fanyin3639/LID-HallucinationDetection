That nucleus has been very strong.\"\nSir Clive Woodward, who coached England to victory in the 2003 World Cup final against Jones' Australia and was in charge for England's last Grand Slam success, tweeted his congratulations.\nHe posted: \"Massive night England & congrats to Eddie and his team, totally deserved and all down to Eddie, just the start for England.\"\nHowever, Jones insists his contribution accounted for \"less than 10%\" of England's 2016 triumph.\n\"The players have done a lot by themselves, all I've tried to do is create a good environment for them,\" he added on Radio 5 live's Sportsweek programme.\n\"When we lose, I get 100% of the blame and that's right. When we win, the credit should go to the players and that's 100% right.\n\"They worked things out on the field really well by themselves.\"\nJones' side will visit Australia in June, facing the Wallabies in Brisbane (11 June), Melbourne (18 June) and Sydney (25 June).\nIt is the first time the countries will meet in a three-match Test series.\nThe former Japan boss says England must improve if they are to win all three Tests, but is confident his side have a chance\n\"It's going to be like bodyline cricket, we've got to get out there and get stuck into them. If we do that we give ourselves a chance.\"\nWhen asked how England would fare if they had to play Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, Jones replied: \"I reckon at this stage we could definitely win two of them, and that's not good enough. We need to be able to win three of them.\"\nInside centre Farrell told BBC One: \"It's brilliant. We set ourselves a goal to be the most dominant team in Europe and we've achieved that.\n\"This squad has been brilliant since we met up at the start of the Six Nations. I'm just chuffed for the boys, we have a few that have been through a lot.\"\nSaracens' Vunipola said that the failure at the World Cup was still on the players' minds, but added he was delighted with England's Grand Slam.\n\"This means a great deal,\" said the number eight. \"It's such a great bunch of guys and we've had a great eight weeks.\n\"No-one can forget the World Cup but this is a great achievement and I'm so happy at the moment.\"\nSummary:\n",
