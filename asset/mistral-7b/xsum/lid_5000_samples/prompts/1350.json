    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nThe Team Sky rider took the yellow jersey from Spain's Alberto Contador after also overtaking Australian rider Richie Porte with two stages remaining.\nA group of five riders led for much of the 140km race from La Ravoire to Vaujany, but Froome was among those to catch the breakaway 3.5km from home.\nThe 31-year-old then burst away to hold off BMC Racing's Porte at the finish.\nSaturday's penultimate stage provides several tough climbs in a 141km ride from La Rochette to the ski resort of Meribel.\nFroome holds a seven-second lead over second-placed Porte and is looking for his third victory in the Dauphine, a race viewed as an important gauge of form before July's Tour de France.\nOn both previous occasions that Froome has won the week-long stage race - in 2013 and 2015 - he has gone on to win the Tour.\nStage five result:\n1.
