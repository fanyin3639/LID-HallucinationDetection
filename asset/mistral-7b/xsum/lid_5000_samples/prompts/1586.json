It felt like a home game for us.\"\nNew Zealand boss Steve Hansen hailed Ireland's victory, which came at the 29th attempt, admitting the All Blacks had been fortunate to win 24-22 in Dublin in 2013.\n\"We've got to make sure the loss isn't wasted, we've got to make sure it takes us somewhere where we get better,\" he said.\nIreland play Canada in their second autumn international in Dublin on 12 November, followed by a rematch with the All Blacks at the Aviva Stadium a week later.\nFormer Ireland captain Keith Wood on BBC Radio 5 live\nIt was just phenomenal from the very start. The atmosphere inside the ground was just something incredibly special.\nFrom the first second the game started, Ireland just attacked.
