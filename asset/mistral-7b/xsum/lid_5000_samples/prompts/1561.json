Viewed from the Earth it is more than 10,000 times fainter than you can see by eye, so you need a fair-sized telescope to see it and that's why it wasn't discovered until 1991,\" said May.\nThe asteroid naming follows a weekend of commemorations of the singer in London, also hosted by May.\nThe guitarist  unveiled an English Heritage blue plaque at his bandmate's childhood home in Feltham, west London.\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram, or if you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.\nSummary:\n",
