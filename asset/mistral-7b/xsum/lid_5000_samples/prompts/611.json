    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nFiona Donnison, 45, of Lightwater, Surrey, had denied the murders of Harry, aged three, and two-year-old Elise, in a trial at Lewes Crown Court.\nTheir bodies were found in holdalls in the boot of Donnison's car, near the former family home in East Sussex.\nDonnison was jailed for life, with a minimum tariff of 32 years, following the killings in January 2010.\nJudge Mr Justice Nicol described the murders as \"deliberate and wicked acts\".\nHe said: \"The premature end of such young lives would have been a tragedy, but this was no accident.\n\"You killed them, you who were their mother. Why you did this defies logical explanation.\n\"It seems it can only have something to do with your feelings for Paul Donnison, the children's father and your former partner.\"\nSpeaking outside court, Mr Donnison, 48, said the pain his family had suffered was \"almost unbearable.\"\nHe also criticised the criminal justice system, saying it was \"biased\" in favour of the person on trial and his former partner had been treated \"with kid gloves\".\nFollowing the sentencing, it can also be revealed that prosecutors attempted to have Donnison tried for the murder of her first child with Mr Donnison.\nAfter the deaths of Harry and Elise, investigators decided to look again at the circumstances behind the death of nine-month-old Mia, who died of a suspected cot death in April 2004.\nProsecutors said that \"taken together\" there was sufficient evidence for a jury to consider a murder charge in her case.\nBut at a pre-trial hearing, Mr Justice Cooke ruled to dismiss the charge of murdering Mia, saying there was no direct evidence in relation to her death.\nDonnison had earlier chosen to stay in the cells as the jury returned its unanimous guilty verdict.\nJurors heard claims Donnison, a former City worker, used the children as the \"ultimate pawns\", in her vendetta against their father.\nProsecutors told the court she smothered the children with their bedding before putting their bodies in the car.\nDonnison declined to give evidence during the trial.\nBut the defence argued she had suffered from depression at the time and said the charges should be reduced to manslaughter.\nJurors heard from mental health professionals who said Donnison swallowed a blade from a pencil sharpener earlier this year, could not remember events surrounding the deaths and could not bring herself to say the children's names.\nBut prosecutors dismissed this, pointing to the level of planning involved in the killings.\nOne clinical psychologist said she believed Donnison to have been \"100% likely to be feigning\" psychological problems or symptoms.\nDonnison was also described in court as a narcissist with an overdeveloped sense of self-importance and entitlement.\nProsecutor Libby Clark said: \"Harry and Elise were regarded as delightful, well-mannered and affectionate children by all who came into contact with them.\n\"Their lives were ended in a sudden and brutal act of revenge by the their mother.\n\"The jury has accepted the Crown's case that Fiona Donnison was not the victim she portrayed herself to be, but a calculating killer of her own children.\"\nSummary:\n",
