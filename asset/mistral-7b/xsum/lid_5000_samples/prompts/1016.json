    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nGovernor Mark Carney came under fire from Brexit supporters for his warnings about the effects of a Leave vote.\nThe Electoral Commission said it made several \"interventions\" during the poll to ensure compliance with the rules.\nOne of these led to The Sun registering as an official Brexit campaigner.\nIn total 123 campaigners registered with the watchdog during the referendum, according to a new Electoral Commission report, spending a total of \u00c2\u00a332.6m.\nThe watchdog said it was broadly happy with the conduct of the referendum but has made a number of recommendations, such as tighter controls on loans taken out by campaigners, the inclusion of staff costs within overall spending limits and larger fines to deter transgressions.\nLast month, it said it was investigating the spending returns of the rival Stronger In and Vote Leave campaigns over incomplete receipts and invoices.\nThe Bank of England and IMF insisted they remained neutral during the referendum but public comments by Mr Carney and the IMF's boss Christine Lagarde about the economic consequences of a Leave vote angered Brexit supporters.\nMr Carney made a number of interventions in the debate, arguing it was the Bank's duty to talk about the risks associated with different outcomes.\nThe commission has now disclosed that it contacted the Bank, IMF and OECD to \"ensure that they understood the rules around campaigning\", as part of its process of \"comprehensive campaign monitoring\".\nIn response, the Bank \"confirmed their understanding of the rules\" and said that while \"purdah\" rules limiting what government departments and the civil service could do in the 28 days before the poll did not apply specifically to the organisation, it would \"voluntarily observe\" the spirit of the guidelines.\nThe IMF and OECD responded that \"their activity was business as usual and in pursuance of international obligations\".\nThe Bank confirmed a conversation had taken place with the Electoral Commission.
