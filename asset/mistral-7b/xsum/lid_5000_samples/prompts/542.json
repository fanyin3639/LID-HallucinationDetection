It was when I started to be myself that the music flowed.\"\nSmith's ballad Stay With Me won both song of the year and record of the year - the former recognises the songwriters, while the latter goes to the performer and producer.\nAccepting the record of the year trophy, he said: \"I want to thank the man who this record is about, who I fell in love with last year.\n\"Thank you so much for breaking my heart because you got me four Grammys.\"\nSmith also performed his the song on stage with Mary J Blige; while his other awards were best new artist and best pop vocal album.\nHe lost out on the best album award to long-serving indie troubadour Beck, who was honoured for his twelfth studio LP, Morning Phase.
