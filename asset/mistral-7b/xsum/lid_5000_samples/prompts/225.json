    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nHelen Thorne from UCAS told BBC Radio Scotland that 28,300 Scottish students had successfully secured their courses.\nMore than 140,000 students north of the border have received their results.\nThe Scottish Qualifications Authority has sent out scores from National 4 and 5, Higher, Advanced Higher and Scottish Baccalaureate exams.\nThe Scottish government said the exams had seen \"another highly successful set of results\", including:\n140,000\nPupils receiving results\n50,000\nPupils getting results by text\n28,300 Scots pupils securing higher education places\n27,400 Scots pupils going to Scottish universities and colleges\n3,900 EU pupils securing places in Scotland\nThe latest results from the SQA suggested that problems with the 2015 Higher Maths exam have not been repeated. The 2015 pass mark had to be cut to 34% after the exam was deemed too difficult, but the 2016 pass mark was approximately 50%.\nFears that replacing part of the Higher English exam against a tight deadline would lead to problems also proved unfounded, with the pass mark for that subject also 50%.\nPass rates in National 4 and 5 exams were roughly in line with those in 2015, while the percentage of candidates passing their Higher exams dipped slightly from 79.2% to 77.2% - although new Higher exams have been phased in over this period.\nNew Advanced Higher exams were introduced for 2016, with an overall 81.7% pass rate.\nDr Janet Brown, the SQA's chief executive and Scotland's chief examining officer, paid tribute to pupils, teachers, lecturers parents and carers.\nShe said: \"This is the first year candidates will have been offered the full range of National Courses as part of Curriculum for Excellence. These results are testament to the dedication of the entire Scottish education system, working in partnership for the benefit of our young people.\n\"The new qualifications are performing well and the results clearly are enabling young people to transition between the levels and develop a wider range of skills.\n\"It is important to recognise the different paths candidates can take to achieve success, whether it be in National Courses, Skills for Work or National Progression Awards.\"\nThe Royal Mail said it had \"pulled out all the stops\" to make sure results were delivered in the post on time, while more than 50,000 pupils also signed up to get their results online or via text message.\nSpeaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, UCAS director Ms Thorne said: \"There is really good news, we have got 28,300 Scottish students who have secured a place at university today and that is the highest that we have ever seen on Scottish results day.\n\"So we want to say a big congratulations to all of them and when the UCAS track system opens students will be able to log in and see if they have got their university place.\"\nMs Thorne also said the number of students from EU countries being accepted to Scottish universities was up 19% to 3,900, saying there was \"no evidence of EU students being put off\" by the Brexit vote.\nThe National Union of Students welcomed the \"hugely encouraging\" figures, while Colleges Scotland said it was \"delighted\" with the results.\nEducation Secretary John Swinney said students could be \"extremely proud of their efforts\".\nMr Swinney said: \"Today's results show that Scotland's learners continue to perform very well, with the second highest number of Higher passes on record, despite a fall in the size of the S5 and S6 year groups. This year is only the second time in history that we have seen more than 150,000 Higher passes, up from around 112,000 just ten years ago.\n\"It is encouraging to see strong performances in qualifications related to wider skills for life and work and I greatly welcome the increase of attainment in Awards, National Certificates and National Progression Awards.\"\nOpposition parties also welcomed the results, with Scottish Conservative education spokeswoman Liz Smith welcoming the fact that issues from 2015 appeared to have been addressed.\nLabour's Iain Gray also voiced congratulations to pupils whose \"hard work has paid off\", although he noted concern about the drop in the pass rate for Highers and called on the government to build on the results by giving schools extra resources.\nThe Royal Mail said results had been delivered to Scottish students in 45 countries around the world, from Australia to Singapore.\nPlanning teams had been working for months to ensure that all results are delivered on time.\nHead of special events and planning Derek Keir said: \"This is a massive day for every pupil in Scotland waiting for their results.\n\"All of our postmen and women, many of whom have children themselves, understand just how important this day is for families.
