    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nAndre Ayew's header gave the Swans the lead before Eriksen levelled with a swerving effort from 25 yards.\nTottenham's Harry Kane sliced Jonjo Shelvey's corner into his own net to restore Swansea's advantage.\nBut Eriksen found the top corner from range to lift Spurs to within two points of the top four.\nSwansea, who move up a place to 11th, remain without a victory in nine attempts against Spurs, dating back to their first season in the Premier League.\nSpurs owe a huge debt of gratitude to Eriksen, who had not scored this season prior to Sunday but put that right in clinical fashion.\nAfter starting well but falling behind to Ayew's goal - an angled header from Jefferson Montero's cross following a lovely, flowing move down the left - the visitors were in need of inspiration and found it in their Danish midfielder, who beat Lukasz Fabianski with a fine strike.\nHe repeated the trick midway through the second half, to again equalise, this time getting his left-sided free-kick to dip over the wall and into the far corner of the net.\nHe almost completed a hat-trick and snatched victory for Spurs when, given space on the edge of the box, he dragged a low shot just past the post.\nHowever, that would have been harsh on Swansea, who gave as good as they got in an entertaining and often end-to-end encounter.\nThat Eriksen was required to rescue his side a second time was down to the misfortune of striker Kane, who scored for the second game in succession but not in the manner he would wish.\nHe looked to have a simple job to clear Shelvey's 31st-minute corner at the near post, but miscued his kick and sliced the ball into his own net.\nHowever, the 22-year-old continued to get into good attacking positions, suggesting that goals - at the right end - will come in what has been a difficult second season for the England international.\nHe had a couple of opportunities to rectify his error - the best a close-range shot which Fabianski did well to save - before he was withdrawn with 10 minutes remaining.\nSwansea's most dangerous player was winger Jefferson Montero, whose direct running at speed proved a constant problem for Spurs defender Kyle Walker.\nMontero provided the assist for Ayew's opener but was often let down by his final ball.\nWalker often reverted to fouling the Ecuadorian to stop him and was fortunate referee Mike Dean held off from booking him until the 88th minute.\nAn earlier yellow card could easily have altered the complexion of their duel and potentially the match.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSwansea boss Garry Monk: \"We were much more like ourselves. We talked all week about getting back to our level, and you could see the passion and the desire we had to win the game was massive.\n\"We have performed fantastically in many games already this season, but we've had a couple where we were well below our standards.\n\"According to some people, a three-game run is a blip, but I know my players have quality.\n\"It's just a question of getting that out of them on a consistent basis.
