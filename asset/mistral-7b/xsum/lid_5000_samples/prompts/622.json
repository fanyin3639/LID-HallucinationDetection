    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nThe Mourne county trailed by a point at the interval after goals by Armagh's Mark Shields and Andrew Murnin.\nBut Kieran McGeeney's men managed just three point in the second half while Down landed six to clinch the victory.\nIt was Down's first Championship win over Armagh since 1992 and they face Monaghan or Cavan in the semi-finals.\nArmagh, who had been favourites to go through, will now face the difficult task of picking themselves up for the All-Ireland qualifiers.\nThis was the first time Down had started their Championship campaign at their Pairc Esler home and the result will be a great boost to them and their manager Eamon Burns.\nThey made the better start and were four points up within the opening nine minutes.\nBut Armagh's opening score was a 13th-minute goal scored by the right boot of wing half-back Shields which reduced the gap to one point.\nArmagh, the top goal scorers in the league earlier in the year, found the net for a second time through Murnin.\nAs with the first goal, Jamie Clarke was instrumental, feeding forward Murnin whose left-foot finish edged Armagh into a one-point lead.\nMurnin almost scored another goal but his shot was touched on to the post by Down defender Anthony Doherty.\nMany might have expected Armagh to pull away to win, but they had a dismal second half and Down grabbed the opportunity to progress.\nWhen Darragh O'Hanlon (2) and Conor Maginn scored, it meant Down had got seven of he last eight points.\nDown wasted chances to stretch their lead but Armagh, with manager McGeeney serving a touchline ban, failed to take advantage.\nIn stoppage-time they needed a goal but, after the match was held up by a brawl between players, it was Down who were celebrating at the end.\nThe Mourne county will face the winners of next Sunday's fourth quarter-final between Cavan and Monaghan.\nDown: M Cunningham; A Doherty, G McGovern, D O'Hagan, D O'Hanlon, C McGovern, C Mooney; K McKernan, N McParland; P Turley, C Maginn, S Millar; J Johnston, R Johnston, C Harrison.\nArmagh: B Hughes; J Morgan, C Vernon, P Hughes; A McKay, B Donaghy, M Shields; S Sheridan, J McElroy; A Forker, O O'Neill, R Grugan; J Clarke, S Campbell, A Murnin.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSummary:\n",
