Just hours before they were legally mandated to press ahead with a formal case, or release the women, prosecutors elected not to move forward with the recommended charges of \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble\".\nThe women, now free on bail, will remain under police surveillance. The activists are part of China's Women's Rights Action Group, a loose network of volunteers who organise events promoting gender equality.\nMany see the women's high-profile arrests as a red light warning to civil rights groups across China to scale down their activities.\nThis year's International Women's Day coincided with China's annual parliamentary session, which usually has tight security and is often preceded by the detention of activists.\nThe women had planned activities including a march in a Beijing park where participants would wear stickers advocating safe sex, and gatherings in Beijing and Guangzhou calling for awareness of sexual harassment on buses.\nChina said on Monday it had lodged a formal complaint to the US over a statement by Secretary of State John Kerry at the weekend in which he called for their unconditional release.\nSummary:\n",
