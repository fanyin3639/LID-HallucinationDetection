    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nEngland's Education Secretary Michael Gove said since the 1990s, test performances had been \"at best stagnant, at worst declining\".\nShanghai in China is the top education system in the OECD's Pisa tests.\nWithin the UK, Scotland outperformed England at maths and reading, but Wales is below average in all subjects.\nMr Gove told MPs that his reforms, such as changing the curriculum, school autonomy and directing financial support towards poorer pupils, were designed to prevent schools in England from \"falling further behind\".\nHe highlighted the rapid improvements that had been made in countries such as Poland, Germany and Vietnam.\nShadow Education Secretary Tristram Hunt called on Mr Gove to take some responsibility for the lack of progress and said the results showed that collaboration between schools and teachers was more effective than market forces.\nGraham Stuart, chair of the education select committee, said the results were \"extremely sobering\" and showed that \"we went nowhere\" despite massive investment in schools.\nBut the Pisa results should not be used to \"talk down our public education system\", said Chris Keates, leader of the NASUWT teachers' union, who argued that high performing countries were those which promoted the professionalism of teachers.\nIn response to the particularly poor results in Wales, Education Minister Huw Lewis said: \"Everybody working in and around the Welsh education sector needs to take a long hard look in the mirror.\"\nSir Michael Barber, chief education adviser for education company Pearson and former Downing Street adviser, said the test result \"focuses minds in education ministries around the world like nothing else\".\nTry the Pisa test yourself\nSingapore maths method\nThe Pisa tests - the Programme for International Student Assessment - have become the most influential rankings in international education, based on tests taken by more than 500,000 secondary school pupils.\nThese measure education standards in Europe, North and South America, Australasia and parts of the Middle East and Asia.\nTunisia was the only African country that participated.\nThe top places in the rankings are dominated by Asian school systems - although China so far does not participate as a whole country, but is represented by high-performing cities such as Shanghai and Hong Kong.\nIn the next set of Pisa tests it is expected that a wider range of provinces in China will be entered.\nShanghai's maths score is the equivalent of three years' schooling above the OECD average.\nSingapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan are among the highest ranked across all subjects.\nThe OECD's Andreas Schleicher, in charge of the Pisa tests, has highlighted Vietnam's \"star performance\".\nThe South East Asian country has entered the top 10 for science and outperformed many much wealthier western education systems, including the United States.\nThe UK has made little progress and remains among the average, middle-ranking countries, in 26th place for maths and 23rd for reading, broadly similar to three years ago.\nSource: OECD\nBut the UK has slipped in science from 16th to 21st place.\nAlthough not directly comparable, because there have been different numbers of countries taking part, this marks a sustained decline, with the UK having ranked 4th in the tests taken in 2000.\nMuch of this falling behind has been caused by other countries improving more quickly.\nThe OECD figures show that there has been almost no change in the UK's test scores, with the results \"flat lining\".\nWithin the UK, Scotland has performed slightly better than England in maths and reading, with England higher for science. Northern Ireland is behind them both across all subjects.\nBut the biggest gap is between Wales and the other parts of the UK, adrift from most of the middle ranking western countries.\nThe lowest ranked countries in this international league table are Peru and Indonesia.

Along with Sweden, Finland had the biggest fall in scores of any country in maths tests.\nSweden has fallen behind eastern and central European countries such as Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Estonia.\nBut Finland still has the highest position of any European country, fifth in science, the only non-Asian country in any of the top fives.\nAmong the strongest performances by English-speaking countries are Ireland, ranked 7th in reading, and Canada ranked 10th in science.\nChile is the strongest performer among South American countries, above the lowest-performing European country, Albania.\nThese Pisa tests provide an increasing level of regional detail and they show the huge variation within a single country.\nIn Italy, the region of Trento is one of the best in the world at maths, but Calabria is far below many European countries, the equivalent of two years behind.\nSource: OECD\nThe US remains average or below average, below countries such as Russia and Spain, but individual states are high performers.\nIf Massachusetts was ranked as a country it would be sixth best in the world, ahead of any European country.\nFrom a low base in previous years, one of the biggest improvers in maths and reading is Qatar, a country that has been a high-profile investor in education.\nKatja Hall, the chief policy director of the CBI employers' organisation, said: \"No issue matters more to the UK economy over the long term than the quality of our education system.\"\nBut she warned the results should be a \"wake-up call\" and that when UK schools are only \"treading water\" that the country's economic performance will suffer.\n\"High-performing schools are the best way to support economic growth and greater opportunity.\"\nThe OECD's secretary general, Angel Gurria, launching the results in Washington in the US, said: \"It's more urgent than ever that young people learn the skills they need to succeed.\n\"In a global economy, competitiveness and future job prospects will depend on what people can do with what they know.
