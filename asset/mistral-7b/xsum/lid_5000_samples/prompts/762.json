    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nNokia will also license its patents and mapping services to Microsoft. Nokia shares jumped 35% on the news, whereas Microsoft's fell more than 5%.\nThe purchase is set to be completed in early 2014, when about 32,000 Nokia employees will transfer to Microsoft.\nNokia has fallen behind rivals Samsung and Apple, while critics say Microsoft has been slow into the mobile market.\nDescribing the deal as a \"big, bold step forward\", Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer told the BBC that his company was in the process of transforming itself from one that \"was known for software and PCs, to a company that focuses on devices and services\".\nBy Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent\nSo who wins and who loses from this deal? Nokia shareholders may be breathing a sigh of relief. Yes, they are only getting $7bn for a business that had a market capitalisation of $150bn in 2007.\nBut the 40% rise in the share price this morning shows they feel this is a far better outcome than they might have expected after years of decline.\nAs for Microsoft, it will be a while before we know whether Steve Ballmer's last big gamble as CEO has paid off.\nHe sees this deal as the final piece in the jigsaw, in his strategy to turn the software company into a devices and services business.\nAt the Helsinki press conference he talked of beating Blackberry for third place in the mobile phone market - and Microsoft's investors may find that number three is not a very profitable place to be.\nFor Finland and for Europe as a whole, this must be seen as a sad day.  It is hard to remember just how recently Nokia was Europe's technology superstar, with a 40% share of one of the world's fastest growing industries and a proud record of innovation.\n\"We've done a lot of great work in the two-and-a-half years that we've been in partnership with Nokia, going literally from no phones to 7.4 million smart Windows phones in the last quarter that was reported,\" he said.\nBut he admitted: \"We have more work to do to expand the range of applications on our product.\"\nMicrosoft, one of the biggest names in the technology sector, has struggled as consumers have shunned traditional PCs and laptops in favour of smartphones and tablet PCs.\nCritics say the firm has been too slow to respond to the booming market for mobile devices. It launched its Surface tablet PCs last year, but sales of the devices have been relatively slow.\nAnalysts said that the company wanted to make sure that it got its strategy right in the mobile phone market.\n\"Mobile is an area of tremendous potential but it has been one of weakness for Microsoft,\" Manoj Menon, managing director of consulting firm Frost & Sullivan, told the BBC.\n\"Clearly the number one priority for the company is to get its mobile strategy right. From a strategy point of view, this deal is the perfect step, The only question is how well they can execute this plan.\"\nBen Wood, an analyst at telecoms consultancy CCS Insight, said: \"It's a necessary gamble by Microsoft to break into mobile, but given its complete reliance on Nokia for Windows Phone devices and the competitive position of Apple and Google with rival phone platforms an understandable move.\n\"It completely reshapes Microsoft's business pushing it firmly into hardware. But it also raises big questions about the sustainability of other firms, including HTC and Blackberry, remaining pure-play phone makers,\" he added.\nNokia was once a leader in mobile phones, but the firm's sales fell 24% in the three months to the end of June from a year earlier.\n1871: Founded.
