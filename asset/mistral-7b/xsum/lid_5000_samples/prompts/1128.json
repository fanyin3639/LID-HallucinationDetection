He wrote: \"Assange... said Russians did not give him the info!\"\nThe president-elect has repeatedly refused to accept the conclusions of the US intelligence community.\nSeveral US agencies including the FBI and the CIA believe Russia directed hacks against the Democratic Party and the campaign of its presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\nThe information, released through Wikileaks and other outlets, was intended to help Mr Trump win the election, say the FBI and CIA.\nOn Tuesday evening, Mr Trump said an intelligence briefing he was due to receive on the issue had been delayed.\n\"Perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange!\" he wrote.\nBut US intelligence officials insisted there had been no delay in the briefing schedule.\nIn an interview with Fox News, Mr Assange repeated his claim that Russia was not behind the leak.\nHe also said a 14-year-old boy could have carried out one of the hacks, on the email account of John Podesta, a top aide of Mrs Clinton.\nIn 2010, several leading Republican figures were calling for the Wikileaks founder to be imprisoned after his website published  thousands of embarrassing diplomatic cables leaked by former Army Pvt Chelsea Manning.\nMr Trump tweeted twice on Wednesday morning in support of what Mr Assange said on Fox News.\nIn another development, Mr Trump's pick for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, has agreed he will cut all ties with Exxon Mobil and comply with conflict-of-interest requirements.\nMeanwhile, Republicans have ditched a plan to gut the independent body that investigates political misconduct after a backlash.\nThe lawmakers' surprise vote to strip the Office of Congressional Ethics of its independence prompted public uproar and a dressing down from Mr Trump on Twitter.\nThe secretive move, which overshadowed the first day of the 115th Congress, was reversed in an emergency meeting.\nThe ethics body was set up in 2008 following a slew of scandals that resulted in several House lawmakers being jailed.\nMr Trump made cleaning up corruption in Washington a key theme of his campaign.\nRepublican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan had argued unsuccessfully against the rule change, which was adopted on Monday night in a closed-door meeting.\nAs the news spread, internet searches for \"who is my representative\" rocketed, according to Google Trends, and constituents tried to call and email lawmakers to express their disgust.\nHouse Republicans called an emergency meeting and abruptly voted to undo the change.\nMr Ryan - who was re-elected by fellow lawmakers on Tuesday as House Speaker - had urged his party to seek bipartisan support and to wait to push for the change later.\nSummary:\n",
