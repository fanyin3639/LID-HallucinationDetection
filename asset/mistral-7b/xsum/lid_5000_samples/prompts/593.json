By the end of 2017, that could rise to 100 times more data.\nPart of the plan is to plug an imminent gap in weather forecasting identified by the US authorities.\nAn ageing generation of 20 weather satellites is due to be retired or may stop working before others are in place, with the gap forecast at between one and five years from next year.\nSpire's satellite and data handling know-how is designed to provide worldwide and round-the-clock information for its clients in global trade, shipping and air traffic control, as well as meteorology.\nIt uses technology known as GPS-Radio Occultation, which has been in development since the 1960s.\nIts censors draw on the the geo-positioning satellite system already used for consumer electronics as a means of measuring atmospheric pressure, temperature and humidity.\nThe announcement of Spire's Glasgow office was made during First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's visit to the USA.\nMs Sturgeon said it confirmed the recent strong flow of investment from American companies.\nSpire said it chose to locate in Scotland because it has a low cost base and an extensive range of universities, with talented engineers.\nStrathclyde and Glasgow universities have been particularly active in space technology.\nPeter Platzer, Spire's chief executive, said: \"We are not only looking for the top 1% of the world's talent pool, but the 1% that demand constant challenge and improvement that has come to embody Spire's culture.\"\nSummary:\n",
