The Northern Ireland Assembly's finance committee is investigating that sale.\nSpeaking on BBC Northern Ireland's Good Morning Ulster on Monday, Ms Long said: \"I would agree with (Ulster Unionist leader) Mike Nesbitt's call that the finance minister should step aside given that, in his position, we need to be very clear who else on the committee was aware of that back channel,\" she said.\nShe also called for an \"independent investigation\" around a twitter feed and who was involved in that.\nThe allegations that loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson was \"coached\" followed leaked Twitter messages between Mr Bryson, Mr McKay and Sinn F\u00e9in member Thomas O'Hara.\nThey exchanged messages before Mr Bryson testified to a Stormont inquiry, chaired by Mr McKay, into the National Asset Management Agency (Nama).\nMr McKay said he accepted this was \"inappropriate, ill-advised and wrong\".\nThe outgoing MLA for North Antrim also apologised for his actions.\nSpeaking last week, Mr Bryson told the BBC that allegations he had been coached by Sinn F\u00e9in before giving evidence were \"absolute nonsense\".\n\"I can categorically state that the source of my information did not come from Sinn F\u00e9in,\" the blogger said.\nHe also denied leaking the information to the media.\nSummary:\n",
