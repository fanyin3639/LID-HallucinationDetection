    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nResham Khan and Jameel Muhktar were attacked on 21 June at traffic lights in Beckton, east London.\nThe cousins had been celebrating Ms Khan's 21st birthday before the attack.\nBoth suffered severe burns to the face and body and Mr Muhktar, 37, was placed in an induced coma. No arrests have been made, police said.\nBoth continue to be treated in hospital. Ms Khan has damage to her left eye and required two skin grafts.\nMr Muhktar, who has since been brought out of his coma, has burns across his body arms, legs, back, neck and the right side of his face as well as damage to his right eye.\nOn social media, Ms Khan said: \"I'm devastated. I keep wondering if my life will ever be the same. Acid attacks in the UK are unheard of for me.\n\"The pain was excruciating. I was struggling to close the window. My cousin struggled to get us away. I saw my clothes burn away in front of me.\"\nAccording to police the two had stopped at traffic lights during their drive when the man approached them and threw the toxic substance at Ms Khan through the window.\nThe attacker then circled around the car and threw more of the acid at Mr Muhktar, before eventually fleeing the scene.\nIn 2016-17, there were 398 victims of crimes involving \"noxious or corrosive\" substances, such as acid. This compares with 146 in 2012-13.\nViolence with injury is the main offence to have seen a rise. In each of 2015-16 and 2016-17, there were 191 victims, compared with 67 in 2014-15.\nNoxious or corrosive substances have also been used in five rapes between April 2012 and March 2017.\nNot all these incidents will involve acid. Because of the way the Metropolitan Police recorded the data, the figures show all victims of crimes where any \"noxious or corrosive\" substances were used.\nThe force released the figures under the Freedom of Information Act.\nSummary:\n",
