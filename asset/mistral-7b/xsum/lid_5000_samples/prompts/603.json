    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nThis week, a taster of what that might be like has been knocking at his door in the wake of the US election result.\nWhile Donald Trump\u2019s visit to the White House was an apparently sobering experience about the level of responsibility he\u2019d soon inherit, Zuckerberg has had a brutal political awakening of his own.\nFacebook\u2019s \u201cfake news\u201d crisis has had the normally stoic 32-year-old visibly irritated, and that\u2019s because for the first time he is being treated like a politician, rather than just a tech CEO.\nWith that comes distrust and anger, not to mention disloyalty in the Facebook ranks and what for him must be the growing realisation that it\u2019s impossible to please everyone.\nWhether Zuckerberg was right to say fake news had little impact is largely irrelevant. By dismissing it apparently without second thought as \u201ccrazy\u201d, he attracted a global pitchfork of people demanding that he at the very least acknowledge the potential role his empire had in Donald Trump\u2019s election win.\nThat interview, carried out by journalist David Kirkpatrick, also contained one other exchange which should give Zuckerberg some serious food for thought - \u200aand may even represent the biggest threat the network and its leader is yet to face.\nKirkpatrick first laid out the context.\nFacebook, he said, was the most influential commercial enterprise ever created, with unparalleled power that is yet to be fully understood.\nZuckerberg himself is a multi-billionaire in charge of a network that has intricate personal data on 1.8 billion people and counting.\n\u201cWhat are the checks and balances that need to exist for this new kind of entity?\u201d asked Kirkpatrick.\n\u201cDo you think about that? At the moment it seems like you are the check and balance.\u201d\nZuckerberg\u2019s answer didn\u2019t come close to addressing the question. He said it was about \u201clistening to what people want\u201d, and continuing to give people \u201cthe power to share\u201d and to make \u201cthe world more open and connected\u201d.\nBut is he confident the checks and balances are in place to stop Facebook over-stepping the mark?\n\u201cI mean\u2026 yeah,\u201d he said, peering out into the audience for support.\nEven though I was watching via a live stream, I could tell the room took an awkward turn. Kirkpatrick moved on - but the issue won\u2019t.\nThe exchange had touched upon a problem that surely deserves more attention.\nThere\u2019s an urgent accountability gap between what technology companies do and what the public is allowed to know.\nThis isn\u2019t about giving up trade secrets. You can inspect KFC\u2019s kitchen without knowing the Colonel\u2019s secret recipe.\nIt\u2019s about being able to examine the reach and influence of technology companies, where supremely powerful men, and a few women, are able to control without any genuine scrutiny other than what appears every three months on a company earnings sheet (and even that\u2019s unnecessarily cryptic).\nRevealing moments like the one Kirkpatrick summoned from the usually robotic Zuckerberg are few and far between. The depressing accepted reality in technology journalism is that if you give a company a hard time, they\u2019ll shut you out.\nAnd that\u2019s because many major technology companies guard their work with barbed wire, and wrap their executives in cotton wool.\nInteractions between big tech and the outside world are orchestrated and engineered to the nth degree. On those rare occasions, even the mildest scrutiny about anything other than the new product being flogged that day is swiftly shot down with tech\u2019s unofficial motto.\n\u201cSorry\u2026 but that\u2019s not what today is about.\u201d\nSo what, you might think. So what if technology companies want to keep their affairs to themselves - \u200ait\u2019s not a public service or anything.\nYou might also think that this is a technology journalist throwing his connected toys out of his smart pram - \u200aand for the most part you\u2019d be right, I\u2019m not ashamed to say.\nBut what Facebook\u2019s challenges over fake news reveal, I think, is that we\u2019re in completely uncharted territory.\nNever has any private company had such immediate power over the way we act, feel, think, date, buy, fight - whatever.\nAnd it\u2019s impossible, if you plan on living in the modern world, to avoid Facebook or Google.\nEven if you never create a Facebook account, your browsing habits will be logged when you visit pages that contain the Facebook \u2018like\u2019 button. Google\u2019s near-$500bn value is made up almost entirely from selling advertising, which is why they\u2019re absolutely everywhere on the internet. It\u2019s the scale that makes the money.\nHow the internal cogs of these sites work is a complete mystery. My colleague Rory Cellan-Jones\u2019 recent radio documentary into Google summarised that its algorithm was so complex that no single person could possibly grasp how it worked.\nThis situation, this imbalance, will surely not be able to last much longer. While technology bosses, Zuckerberg in particular, talk about their \u201cmission\u201d to \u201cconnect the world\u201d, we do know that under their watch unacceptable things do take place.\nThanks to whistleblowers and investigative journalists, for instance, we know that Google at one time scooped up private wi-fi data from homes as it carried out its Street View trips. We know that Facebook knowingly manipulated News Feeds in an attempt to alter users\u2019 emotions.\nYou can see how both of those examples could have seemed harmless - \u200aor at least fascinating - to the engineers involved.\nBut what they demonstrate is that what may seem a bright idea for the tech sites may be directly at odds for what is good for the users themselves.\nOne person in agreement with this is Zuckerberg, in 2009 at least. That was when Facebook was at around 200m users, and he posted a video message (in a shirt and tie!) saying how he wanted users to have a bigger say in how the site is governed.\nA special section - \u200aFB Site Governance - was set up. Check on it today and you\u2019ll see there have been no significant updates since 2012 - other than to tell people about privacy policy changes.\nSoft power\nZuckerberg\u2019s political ambitions, if he has them, are off to a very rocky start. The fake news row was a big test, and he handled it poorly - \u200adragging out the issue in the news agenda for well over a week.\nHad he been thinking like a politician, as he now must, things could have gone differently. The new reality for Zuckerberg is that it\u2019s no longer okay to be an awkward tech nerd. Instead he must deal with his users\u2019 concerns with respect, and not call them \u201ccrazy\u201d.\nThere\u2019s a lot in it for him to get things right. Zuckerberg\u2019s global ambitions will live or die on his ability to be an astute political operator. He already played a bad hand in India, where local businesses said he was harming their chances online.\nIf Facebook is to hit the potential of connecting the unconnected, Zuckerberg will need to think like a world leader and engage in soft power and openness in order to build, or restore, trust.\nAnd he must stop using \u201cincreased engagement\u201d as the key metric for Facebook\u2019s success. What\u2019s popular isn\u2019t always good, and what\u2019s good isn\u2019t always popular.\nZuckerberg\u2019s record on dealing with controversy has been pretty solid, and there\u2019s of course no suggestion he has any bad intentions with Facebook.\nBut this week has demonstrated that it\u2019s simply no longer enough for Zuckerberg to deny an issue and expect people to blindly take his word for it. Even if he is right, he\u2019ll have to learn how to prove it.\nBecause the message the public appears to have given Zuckerberg, and perhaps all of Silicon Valley, is that when you\u2019re unfathomably powerful, \u201cno comment\u201d is fast becoming not good enough.\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook\nSummary:\n",
