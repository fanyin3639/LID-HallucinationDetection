    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nThe vehicle appears as a double dot.\nThe view from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has been colour enhanced to emphasise certain ground features.\nThese include the disturbance in the soil made either side of the vehicle by the rocket powered crane that lowered Curiosity into Gale Crater a week ago.\n\"We can clearly see Curiosity - it's like two bright spots that we see, and their shadows.  And then it's surrounded by the blast pattern from the descent stage - those little blue fans right next to it (false colour blue),\" explained Alfred McEwen, the principal investigator on MRO's High Resolution Image Science Experiment (HiRise) camera.\nSince its 6 August (GMT) touchdown, engineers have been checking out the rover's systems and instruments.\nAnd the past four days have been spent upgrading the vehicle's onboard software.\nCuriosity runs two computers - a main unit and a back-up. Both have been updated to what programmers call the R10 configuration.\nThis software is optimised for surface operations, enabling the rover to drive, drill into rocks and take samples into the laboratories inside its body.\nThe update also removed all the code used by Curiosity during the complex manoeuvres required to land in Gale Crater, a deep depression on Mars' equator.\nThe mission team will continue to shake down the vehicle and its instruments in the coming days. A first drive is expected next week.\n\"We will drive just a little bit forward and then turn and back up. That's\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 in five or six days, assuming all goes well between now and then,\" said mission manager Michael Watkins.\nCuriosity's ultimate goal is to go to the base of the big mountain in the centre of Gale known as Mount Sharp.\nThere, it is expected to find rocks that were laid down billions of years ago in the presence of liquid water.\nCuriosity - also  called the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) - will probe these sediments for evidence that past environments on Mars could once have favoured microbial life.\nThe key science targets are about 8km away, but it will take several more km to find a drivable route across the rugged terrain.\nResearchers hope to have the rover at the base of Mount Sharp in a year's time.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter\nSummary:\n",
