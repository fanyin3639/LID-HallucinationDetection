    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nMurley Silver Band, from Fivemiletown, is representing Northern Ireland in the competition in Lille on Saturday.\nThe band, which was formed in 1924, is made up of 30 amateur musicians.\nMembers are from all walks of life and range in age from their teens to their 70s.\nStephen Bloomfield, the band's chairman, is a bank manager who has played in the band for 44 years.\n\"We are a country band. We're a family-based band from this community and for us to go and represent the band in Lille at the European brass championships is just an amazing honour,\" he said.\n\"We want to give our best and we're rehearsing very hard for that but we also want to go there and enjoy the experience of being part of the European Brass Band Championships - that's just something quite special.\"\nHis niece Katie Bloomfield is a GCSE student who plays trombone and percussion. Her mother and father also play in the band.\nShe said: \"The band is made up of many different families. I just think it just feels really like you're at home in the band room and you're with family and friends all the time, so it's really important to keep that going.\n\"I just enjoy being able to have friendships with people of all different ages and I really, really enjoy the music.\n\"It's sometimes challenging but it's really rewarding when you can play it and it sounds good,\" she added.\nSome people who have moved away from the area return twice a week for rehearsals and to take part in concerts and competitions.\nBoris Pinto, a doctor now living in Belfast, said he feels part of something special: \"My drive is about three hours round trip.\n\"In the deep dark of winter if you're diverted off the motorway, you can wonder why on earth am I doing all of this?\"\nHe says it is for \"wonderful music, great people, and keeping the tradition going\".\nMurley has competed in Europe twice before but no band from Northern Ireland has won the competition.\nConductor William Hill is hoping that will change this year.\n\"I always go with the attitude 'we go there and we go to win' and we want to put on a really good performance and represent Northern Ireland as best we possibly can,\" he said.\nSummary:\n",
