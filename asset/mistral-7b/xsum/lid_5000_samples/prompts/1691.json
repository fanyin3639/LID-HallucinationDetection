    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nPaddy Hill was speaking after Michael Hayes told the BBC he took collective responsibility for the attack.\nThe Birmingham Six spent 17 years in prison before their convictions were quashed in 1991.\nMr Hill said Hayes speaking out earlier would have done nothing for them.\nExplosions at two Birmingham city centre pubs - the Mulberry Bush and Tavern in then Town - killed 21 people in November 1974.\nMr Hill said that in the aftermath of the attacks, an IRA spokesman said that if any of their members were found to have been involved in the bombings they would be court martialled.\n\"That's why they all [the real bombers] denied it when they went home,\" he said.\n\"They were interrogated. They all denied that they had anything to do with the bombings. It was two years later when they actually found out the truth.\"\nHe said that if Hayes had handed in himself in at that time it would not have helped the Birmingham Six.\n\"No, it wouldn't have done, because we'd already been convicted,\" Mr Hill said.\n\"It wouldn't have helped us at all. All the British establishment would've said is that it was an IRA plot to get us out.\"\nMr Hill described Hayes' apology as \"ridiculous\".\n\"That to me is an insult to the people, the families of those who are dead, after all this time,\" he said.\n\"I'm just surprised that coming out at this stage 40-odd years later and admitting it, I just don't understand why he's done it now.\n\"But nonetheless I welcome it, at least it might do something to stop the whispering campaign that it was all about the Birmingham Six from within the British establishment.\"\nHayes, who now lives in south Dublin, refused to reveal who planted the bombs in the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town but said he was speaking out to give \"the point of view of a participant\".\nHe claimed the bombs had not been intended to kill people, and that he was sorry innocent people were killed.\nRelatives of those killed have rejected the apology as \"gutless and spineless\".\nAn inquest into the bombings has been re-opened following a campaign by victims' families, who feel they have been denied justice and that their loved ones have been forgotten.\nWest Midlands Police said their investigation remained open and they would respond to \"any new significant information to bring those responsible to justice\".\nSummary:\n",
