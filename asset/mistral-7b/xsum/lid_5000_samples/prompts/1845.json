    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nExperts at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) were unable to reach a consensus, so moved the matter to a meeting in 2015.\nThe US argued at the meeting that leap seconds were causing problems for communication and navigation systems.\nBut the UK said that the long-term consequences of losing it were great.\nAn ITU spokesman said that Japan, Italy, Mexico and France all supported the United States' stance on losing the leap second, while Germany and Canada, like the UK, wanted the extra second to stay.\nMore countries though, including Nigeria, Russia and Turkey, wanted further study.\nAs a result, the ITU decided that more research was needed to consider the broader social implications of losing the leap second before a decision could be taken.\nThe ITU suggested that a study group should investigate the issue, before presenting any proposals at the next World Radio Conference in 2015.\nIt means that for now, the world's time will continue to be linked to the Earth's rotation.\nThe next leap second is due to be added on 30 June 2012.\nOut of time\nThe leap second was introduced in 1972.\nIt was added to keep our modern timekeepers - atomic clocks, which rely on the vibrations in atoms to provide a very accurate measurement of time - in line with our slightly less reliable timekeeper, the Earth.\nBecause our planet wobbles a little on its axis as it spins, it means some days end up being a few milliseconds longer or shorter than others.\nThis means that over time, the time based on atomic clocks, and the time based on the Earth's rotation drift further and further apart.\nWhen this difference is deemed by the International Earth Rotation Service, which monitors the Earth's activity, to be approximately 0.9 seconds, a leap second is added to pull the two back into sync.\nSometimes a leap second can be added every year, sometimes not for several, with six-months' notice provided before action needs to be taken.\nThose who wanted to lose the leap second said that the one-second increments were becoming increasingly problematic for a vast range of modern navigational and communication systems, such as sat-nav, financial services, air traffic control and the internet.\nThese all rely on having a continuous and stable timescale, so adding a somewhat unpredictable, one-second increment can be disruptive.\nThe UK, though, says any problems are exaggerated - and that losing the leap second could cause long-term problems, as the time based on the atomic clocks and the time based on the Earth's rotation would move ever further apart.\nOver decades, this would amount to a minute's difference, but over 500 years this could be an hour, and over thousands of years, the Sun could be setting when atomic clocks claim it is morning.\nPeter Whibberley, senior research scientist at the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington, UK, who is leading the UK's delegation, said: \"This result achieves the UK's aims of securing much broader debate and understanding of the consequences of ending the link between UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) and solar time before a final decision is taken.\"\nSummary:\n",
