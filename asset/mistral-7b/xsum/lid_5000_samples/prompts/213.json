    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe new Premier League season starts this weekend and former England captain Lineker is rueing a rash tweet from back in December.\nHe had so little faith in Leicester - his former team, who he scored 95 goals for in 194 appearances - holding on to their lead in the Premier League that he pledged to \"do the first MOTD of next season in just my undies\" if they won the championship.\nThe Foxes went on to win their first top-flight title by 10 points.\nSo, will he go ahead with it live on BBC One at 22:30 BST?\n\"I am doing my best to pluck up the courage to go there with just my undies on, as I said I would,\" Lineker told BBC Sport.\n\"When I tweeted that silly bet back in December, I categorically knew there was zero chance of Leicester winning the league. Zero chance. It happened but it was magical, it was great.\n\"It is a one off and a sporting miracle that has landed me in my underwear.\"\nJudging by this Instagram post, it hasn't escaped Lineker's mind...\nEven Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri is keen to see what happens.\nThere have been messages of support - or concern - from fellow ex-professionals. We expect Ian Wright and Alan Shearer will have some words of encouragement in the studio.\nBut the man himself is keeping his cards close to his chest - for now.\nAnd just in case you miss it, don't worry. There will be a second chance.\nThis season you will be able to watch Match of the Day on the BBC iPlayer from midnight on Sunday - and Match of the Day 2 from midnight on Monday.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSummary:\n",
