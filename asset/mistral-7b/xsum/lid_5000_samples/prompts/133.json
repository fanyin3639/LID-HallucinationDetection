They do not think this is something they can ignore,\" he added.\nA MasterCard spokesman said it was concerned the \"overly prescriptive approach of how fraud should be reduced\" would undermine the regulator's overall goal.\nIn its consultation response, Paypal said \"unfriendly\" security checks would affect \"almost any digital payment, regardless of the actual risk posed\".\nMr Richards said under the plans, payments above \u20ac10 would require proof of at least two of the following:\nThe European Banking Authority said it had to make a \"difficult trade-off\" between a high degree of security in retail payments and customer convenience.\n\"We are currently in the process of assessing whether the trade-offs we made achieve the right balance and which, if any, changes we will need to make before finalising the technical standard and publishing it at the beginning of next year,\" it said in a statement.\nThe changes are part of the European Commission's forthcoming Payment Services Directive 2.\nSummary:\n",
