They spent 40 years together, the court heard.\nIt was the investigation into Righton - convicted of importing images of child abuse in 1992 - that led to MP Tom Watson using Parliamentary privilege in 2012 to allege there was \"clear intelligence\" of a VIP child sex abuse ring.\nThe victim, whose anonymity is protected, came forward to police in 2013.\nThe abuse happened between February 1978 and February 1980 when the boy was at the school described at the time as being for \"maladjusted boys\".\nJudge Alistair McCreath told Alston: \"I acknowledge that at the time you committed these offences you were in a very close relationship with an older man who had very particular and aggressive views about the propriety of sexual behaviour with minors.\"\nHe said while he had the \"intelligence, maturity and ability to say no\" to \"some extent at least\" his behaviour was influenced by Righton.\nThe court heard Righton and Alston's friend Charles Napier - now a convicted paedophile - would also be present on some occasions.\nNapier, a former teacher from Sherborne in Dorset, was at one time treasurer of the Paedophile Information Exchange.\nAlston was found not guilty of four counts of indecent assault and two counts of indecency with a child.\nThe jury was unable to reach verdicts on one count each of the same offences and they will lie on file.\nSummary:\n",
