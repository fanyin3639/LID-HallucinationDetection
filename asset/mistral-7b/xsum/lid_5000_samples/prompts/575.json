We believe and sincerely hope she will be found safe and well.\"\nHer friends and family have been posting widely on social media asking for her whereabouts.\nSalvage teams started raising the Nautilus from the seabed in Koge Bay, south of Copenhagen, on Saturday.\nPolice are hunting for witnesses and camera footage to determine whether the missing woman had disembarked after setting off.\nFootage aired by Denmark's TV2 shows Mr Madsen getting out of what appeared to be a private boat, giving reporters a thumbs-up sign, saying: \"I am fine, but sad because Nautilus went down.\"\nHe later told a reporter: \"I was out on a rehearsal trip, tinkering with different things in the submarine. Then a defect happened with a ballast tank which wasn't that serious - until I tried to repair it - then it suddenly became very serious.\n\"After that it took 30 seconds for Nautilus to sink. I couldn't close the hatch or anything. But that might be OK, as I would still be down there then.\"\nMs Wall had been writing about Mr Madsen and his submarine, which at one stage was the largest privately-made vessel of its kind.\nMr Madsen made headlines in 2008 when he built the home-made submarine, that is almost 18 metres long, by using online crowd-funding.\nSummary:\n",
