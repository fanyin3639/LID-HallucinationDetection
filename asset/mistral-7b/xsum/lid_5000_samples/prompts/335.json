    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nTwo spacecraft have been ordered at a cost of roughly 550m euros (\u00c2\u00a3405m).\nThey will be built at the aerospace giant's factories in Portsmouth and Stevenage in southern England.\nInmarsat specialises in providing mobile connections to ships, planes, oil and gas platforms, and the broadcasting industry.\nThe new spacecraft will be known as the Inmarsat-6 series. They will update services currently offered in the L-band part of the radio spectrum.\nThese connections are handled today by the Inmarsat-4 series, which was launched in 2005. The expectation is that these earlier platforms will be operational until at least 2020, by which time the I-6s should be ready for lift-off.\nInmarsat's decision to place the order with Airbus is a major boost for UK space manufacturing.\nThe telecoms company is the world's biggest player in its field, and so the Airbus workers in Portsmouth and Stevenage will see the contract as a tremendous endorsement of their skills and expertise.\nIt will also be regarded as a very positive return on the strategy pursued by ministers and the UK Space Agency, who have targeted R&D investments in the telecoms sector.\nThis has seen, for example, the development of state-of-the-art digital signal processors for satellites that can channel significant bandwidth and power to specific locations on the ground at the drop of a hat.\nIn addition to being more capable than the I-4s, the I-6s will differ in two key respects.\nOne is their frequency of operation. As well as the L-band, which is where Inmarsat has many legacy services, the new satellites will carry a Ka-band payload.\nThis higher frequency part of the radio spectrum is where much of the new sector growth will occur - such as in-flight connections for aeroplanes.  Inmarsat recently launched an I-5 series of satellites. These all operate in Ka.\nThe other big difference from the I-4s, and indeed the I-5s, will be the new satellites' architecture. They will be what are called \"all-electric\" spacecraft.\nThis means they will use an ion engine to manoeuvre themselves once they come off the top of the launch rocket.\nThis is normally done with a large chemical thruster, but a significant mass saving can be made if the final orbital positioning is done using an engine that spits out a stream of charged gas.\nSuch ion engines, although extremely efficient, do however take longer to achieve the task in hand, resulting in a delay of several months to get the satellite on-station.\nThe plus side for the satellite owner is that they can use the mass saving either to select a smaller, cheaper rocket or to add additional payload capability.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos\nSummary:\n",
