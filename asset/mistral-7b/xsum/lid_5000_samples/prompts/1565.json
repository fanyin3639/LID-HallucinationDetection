    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nStuart Armstrong gave the hosts the lead with a 25-yard drive that flew in through a crowd of players.\nJordan Jones drew Killie level against the run of play after the break but Scott Sinclair soon made it 2-1.\nJames Forrest nodded home the third to confirm Celtic's win and put an end to Killie's hopes of securing a top-six finish this season.\nWith Partick Thistle beating Motherwell 1-0 at Firhill, they cannot be caught in the race for a top-six berth.\nLee McCulloch's side gave the champions a guard of honour as they took to the field and the interim boss showed Celtic further respect by deploying a five-man defence.\nGary Dicker, Iain Wilson and Scott Boyd filled the central roles with Luke Hendrie and Greg Taylor occupying the full-back berths. The formation restricted Celtic early on but the problem for Killie was that every one of their clearances dropped to players in green and white.\nChances eventually came for the hosts, with Sinclair firing wide from Forrest's cross before Callum McGregor's deflected effort was tipped over by keeper Freddie Woodman.\nThe breakthrough arrived midway through the first half and it was the player of the month for March who did the damage. Armstrong decided to try his luck from distance and his shot appeared to take a slight touch as it flew past Woodman for the midfielder's 14th goal of the season.\nLast ditch tackles from Wilson and Boyd denied McGregor and Armstrong before Kieran Tierney sent a left foot volley wide of the target as the home side were unable to increase their lead before the interval.\nAt times it was like a training game for Celtic as they maximised possession and Killie sat back and hoped to hit them on the break.\nThe tactic paid off, though, as the Rugby Park men squared it against the run of play. Conor Sammon's attempted shot broke into the path of Jones and his effort from 16 yards took a deflection to beat Craig Gordon.\nThat goal spurred Celtic into action and from a free kick delivered by Armstrong, Dedryck Boyata's headed knockdown was turned across the face of goal by McGregor for Sinclair to net with a close range tap in.\nMoussa Dembele made an immediate impact as a substitute, contributing to Celtic's third goal. His deflected shot came back off the Killie keeper's left hand post and winger Forrest headed the rebound into the net from two yards out.\nThe result extends Celtic's unbeaten domestic run to 39 games as Killie experienced their first defeat away from home in their last seven games.\nCeltic manager Brendan Rodgers: \"I thought it was an outstanding team performance. We played our shape very very well, the quality of the movement, the speed. It was difficult in the beginning because Lee (McCulloch) obviously set his team out very tight in their organisation in a real low position and that's always difficult to break down.\n\"But we showed quality and great patience and I must say big applause as well to the crowd because they're now seeing what we're trying to do - they're not getting frustrated, they're understanding at times they're going to have to be patient.\n\"Our only mistake was for the goal which was the counter attack but every other element we showed a lovely charisma in the game today. We got three goals and with a bit more luck we could have had another one or two.\"\nInterim Kilmarnock boss Lee McCulloch: \"I thought first half we were too deep, stood off the game too much and allowed Celtic a little bit too much respect. Second half we changed the system and decided to go a little bit higher up the pitch.\n\"I'm delighted with the way the boys played and the character and concentration they showed for most of the game.\n\"We get back in the game and gather a little bit of momentum then we just switch off for a set play as we have done a couple of times this season - that's the most disappointing part of the day.\n\"Did we deserve to win then game - absolutely not. But I'm proud of the way the boys showed character and passed the ball, especially in the second half at times and maybe on another day we could have stolen a point.\"\nMatch ends, Celtic 3, Kilmarnock 1.\nSecond Half ends, Celtic 3, Kilmarnock 1.\nFoul by Scott Brown (Celtic).\nAdam Frizzell (Kilmarnock) wins a free kick in the defensive half.\nCorner,  Celtic.
