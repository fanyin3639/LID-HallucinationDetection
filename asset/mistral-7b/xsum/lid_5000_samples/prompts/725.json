    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nSam Saunders put the Bees ahead early on when he lobbed keeper Marcus Bettinelli from the edge of the box.\nFulham, who are 21st in the Championship table, were 2-0 down two minutes later when Hogan found the net with a low, powerful shot.\nHogan then volleyed his second, and his fifth in 93 minutes since returning from a knee injury, before the break.\nThe former Rochdale striker has featured only seven times for the Bees since the start of the 2014-15 season and began his comeback in March.\nDespite \u00a311m signing Ross McCormack going close in the first half with a shot bouncing off a post, Fulham's players were booed off at half-time.\nFulham wasted several chances after the break, with Tom Cairney chipping over when in a good position and Moussa Dembele wasting a chance to shoot with the goal in sight.\nMcCormack then saw his dipping free-kick expertly turned over the bar by Bees keeper David Button.\nBut it was a deserved victory for Brentford, who went close to adding a fourth early in the second half when Konstantin Kerschbaumer's low drive was well blocked by Fulham keeper Bettinelli.\nBrentford boss Dean Smith on Scott Hogan: \"He's not talking to me at the moment because I took him off but he was sitting there with ice all over his body so we have to go softly softly with him.\n\"We have to manage him carefully with the medical team, but if he stays fit then we will see much more of him next season because he's a natural goalscorer.\n\"He's put himself in a difficult position with the supporters in terms of expectation now.\"\nFulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic: \"It was embarrassing in first 45 minutes. We played without any character and desire. We are ashamed of that performance.\n\"We've promised things this season and not delivered them, but I know how to fix this problem and the club knows how to fix this problem.\n\"The honeymoon is over, but the cause of this was not my fault. It was the fault of other people, but in the summer I know what the problem is and I am ready to fix it and show ambition.\"\nSummary:\n",
