After all, hacking group Anonymous had tweeted this just yesterday:\nBut the NYSE was quick to try and stamp out those rumours:\nOf course, if in doubt, always blame the IT guys:\nIn classic Twitter fashion, everyone started making the same joke:\nThankfully there were a few more inventive Twitter comics out there:\n[Confused?
