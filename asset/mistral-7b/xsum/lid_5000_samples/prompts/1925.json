Nothing has changed since 1973.\n\"We will take a civil action and we will go after this soldier.\"\nThe initial inquest was held in 1973 and recorded an open verdict. A second inquest was ordered by the Attorney General in 2009 following an examination by the Historical Enquiries Team.\nThe report found that the RUC investigation at the time was \"hopelessly inadequate and dreadful\".\nAs a result of the report, an inquest in 2011 found that the teenager posed no risk and dismissed claims that soldiers had shouted warnings before firing.\nDaniel, a labourer, was unarmed when he was shot close to his home in Creggan during Operation Motorman, an army-mounted attempt to re-take areas of the city.\nHis cousin Christopher, 16, was also shot in the head by the same soldier, but survived.\nAfter the decision on Tuesday, the prosecution service's Assistant Director of Central Casework, Michael Agnew, said: \"The standard of proof that the prosecution must reach in a criminal trial is the high one of beyond reasonable doubt.\"\nMargaret Brady told BBC Radio Foyle that the family will continue to fight for justice.\n\"My reaction was just dumbfounded,\" Mrs Brady said. \"It makes me more determined to go on because somebody has to stand up for the innocent victims.\n\"My brother was innocent and these people need to be held to account.\"\nIn 2007, the British government apologised to the family after describing Daniel Hegarty as a terrorist.\nSummary:\n",
