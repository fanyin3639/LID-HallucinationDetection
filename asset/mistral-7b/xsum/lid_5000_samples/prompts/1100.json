    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nThe world champion All Blacks have won their last 34 games at the Auckland ground, while Wales have not beaten New Zealand in 26 matches since 1953.\nBut asked whether his team would be daunted by the occasion, kicking coach Jenkins said: \"I don't think so.\"\n\"It's New Zealand; no matter where you play them they're going to be tough.\"\nWales are returning to Eden Park for the first time since losing 21-18 against Australia in the 2011 World Cup third-place play-off.\nThat came after their World Cup dream had ended in a 9-8 semi-final defeat by France at the same venue, a game which saw captain Sam Warburton sent off for a tip-tackle.\n\"It didn't go too well for us on those occasions, but hopefully we can turn that around and play well and hopefully we can come away with something,\" said former fly-half Jenkins.\n\"It should be a fantastic occasion. It's a sell-out and it's their first game back as world champions.\n\"There's no bigger test than New Zealand in New Zealand and here at Eden Park, so the guys are excited and hopefully we can put out a big performance.\"\nJenkins says his side must do the basics well if they are to beat the All Blacks on their own turf for the first time.\n\"The back three they've got will cause damage to most sides so you've got to be accurate in your kicking and you've got to be accurate in your kick-chase,\" he said.\n\"You've got to make your tackles. We have to be organised and put some pressure on them.\n\"The last few times we've played the All Blacks we've been there or thereabouts with about 15 minutes to go.\n\"But that's why they're the best side in the world because they go away [from you] in the last 10 or 15 minutes. The game is never over and they keep coming.\"\nSummary:\n",
