I knew he couldn't. There was nothing else I could say, nothing else I could do.\"\nMr Lackey said he later saw Mr Howard turning yellow and slumping forward in the crowd.\nThe jury heard how another Liverpool fan, Paul Taylor, saw Tommy in the pen after the crush and tried to give him the \"kiss of life\".\nMr Taylor said Tommy's eyes were open and \"watery\", he looked \"very peaceful\" and was unconscious, but he did not check for a pulse or breathing.\nA police officer later checked Tommy for a pulse through his gloves before saying \"leave him, he's dead\", Mr Taylor said.\nMr Butler later found Tommy among other casualties and thought he saw \"a flicker in his eyes\".\n\"I thought there was a chance he might survive, so I picked him up,\" he said.\nThe jury heard how Mr Butler and some fans carried Tommy the length of the pitch to where someone who he now believes was an ambulance man told him: \"He is not alive, take him to the gym.\"\nA doctor confirmed Tommy's death in the gym at 15:55 BST.\nAnother police officer, Peter Muir, said he found Mr Howard inside pen three after the crush.\nHe said he was drawn towards him because his eyes were \"flickering\" and his lips were \"quivering\".\nThe officer said he carried Mr Howard through a tunnel at the back of the pen and laid him on a grassed area.\nHe checked Mr Howard's pulse and in a statement said he felt a \"slight response\" at one point.\nHe continued with CPR and an off-duty nurse came over to help, but Mr Muir said they were told by a doctor that Mr Howard had died.\nThe inquests, in Warrington, are due to resume on Friday.\nBBC News: Profiles of all those who died\nSummary:\n",
