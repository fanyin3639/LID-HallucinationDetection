    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nAfter resuming on 128-0, the visitors batted all day to secure a fourth draw in nine games which leaves them second after Middlesex's win at Scarborough.\nEngland's Stuart Broad and Brett Hutton took two quick wickets each.\nBut, after opening partner Tom Smith went for 71, Hameed stayed on to make 122 as Lancs reached safety on 304-7.\nSmith only added five to his overnight score before Harry Gurney found the edge, but following his first-innings 70, the former Lancashire captain, who was out for 13 months with a back injury before returning in May, amassed 141 runs in the match.\nBroad, who warmed up for next week's first Test against Pakistan by taking 2-45 in 25 overs, gave Notts hope when he took the new ball.\nHe removed Luke Procter and Alviro Petersen, clean bowled playing no stroke, in the same over.\nHutton then finally had teenage Lancashire centurion Hameed caught behind, before prompting Liam Livingstone to prod to mid on.\nWith a lead of just 40 and still 45 overs to go in the day, it was game on, but captain Steven Croft battened down the hatches, making an unbeaten 34 from 141 deliveries in an obdurate three-hour-and-seven-minute vigil.\nLancashire, who visit Worcestershire in the T20 Blast this Friday night, return to Championship action on Saturday week (16 July), at home to Durham at Southport.\nNotts, who are also in Blast action this Friday at Northampton, start their next Championship game at home to Somerset on 17 July.\nNottinghamshire stand-in skipper Steven Mullaney told BBC Radio Nottingham:\n\"We just didn't have enough in the tank to get the last three wickets. Fair play to Lancashire. Hameed deserves a lot of credit. He played fantastically and so did Tom Smith, until we got him.\"\n\"We had little sniffs but it wasn't to be but they should all be very proud of themselves over what they've done over the last four days.\"\nNotts director of cricket Mick Newell told BBC Radio Nottingham:\n\"Stuart Broad showed his quality. He's been terrific over the four days. As usual, he's given us 100 per cent commitment and he bowled a skilful spell which gave us a tantalising glimpse.\"\n\"Imran Tahir toiled away. I doubt anyone has bowled 45 overs in an innings here since the days of Stuart MacGill. It turned slowly, so batsmen had time to adjust.\"\nLancashire director/ head coach Ashley Giles told BBC Radio Manchester:\n\"The groundwork was done yesterday by Haseeb and Tom. It was a fantastic partnership. They showed a lot of maturity.\n\"Tom has struggled for runs but come really good this game and Has showed a lot of maturity for a man of his years.\n\"The only time I left the balcony was when I went across to see the press and we lost four wickets, so I hurried back and it calmed down a bit.\n\"It was a bit anxious at tea but Crofty played a really good captain's innings.\"\nSummary:\n",
