    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nDanny Welbeck opened the scoring on seven minutes, put through by Alexis Sanchez to round Joel Robles and slot home for his fourth of the season.\nOn 42 minutes, teenager Alex Iwobi marked his maiden Premier League start with a first goal for the club.\nThe result leaves the Gunners 11 points behind leaders Leicester City.\nIt was a first win in four league matches for third-placed Arsenal, who dominated the game.\nIn contrast, Everton failed to test their opponents properly and had just two shots on target as their dreadful home form - now four defeats in five in the league - continued.\nRelive Arsenal's stroll at Goodison Park\nArsenal began the week with a 2-1 home defeat by Watford in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup being knocked out of the FA Cup.\nThen on Wednesday they lost 3-1 to Barcelona at the Nou Camp as they were knocked out of the Champions League.\nWith only the league to focus on, this looked like a must-win match for the Gunners if they were to stay in touch with Leicester.\nThere are also not yet assured of a Champions League place with fifth-placed West Ham only three points behind before kick-off.\nIn the event, they responded to last week's disappointments with a positive performance and earned a first league win since beating Leicester 2-1 on 14 February.\nIt was a dream full league debut by Iwobi, the 19-year-old Nigeria midfielder.\nHe has come through the ranks at Arsenal's Hale End academy and made his first-team debut in October's 3-0 League Cup defeat by Sheffield Wednesday and signed a new contract last year.\nIwobi was born in Lagos but played for England's youth teams before deciding to represent Nigeria and has won two caps for the Super Eagles.\nHe boasts footballing pedigree as his uncle is former Bolton and Nigeria legend Jay-Jay Okocha.\nIwobi was brimming with confidence in attack and had the most shots of any of his team-mates.\nHe linked well with Welbeck and showed composure and strength to hold off the challenge of Ramiro Funes Mori before scoring his goal.\nEverton have now won just one of their past nine Premier League games at Goodison Park.\nThey have the league's worst defensive record at home, conceding 28 goals - already the most they have shipped in a 38-game Premier League season.\nThe Toffees' record is worse than bottom club Aston Villa, who have let in 25 at Villa Park.\nThey have kept only two clean sheets at home in the league this season and their Goodison Park record reads: played 16, won four, drawn four, lost eight.\nThe fans were audibly frustrated at their team's poor form and the home defence was exposed horribly by Hector Bellerin's well-flighted pass for Iwobi's goal.\nManager Roberto Martinez changed formation at half-time, bringing on defender John Stones for midfielder Muhamed Besic and switching to a back three.\nThe change worked as Everton looked more compact in the second half, but they rarely threatened a comeback.\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"It was a very significant win for us and a mental test. We continued the level of performance against Barcelona.\n\"I like this group, I like the mental attitude - it has been questioned and it hurts me.\n\"When you work every day with them you see how much effort they put in.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nEverton manager Roberto Martinez: \"We were second best. I thought Arsenal had more bite and intensity.\n\"It was so disappointing, the contrast in performance from last Saturday [the 2-0 FA Cup victory over Chelsea] is difficult to explain.\n\"We never got a platform into the game, we were ineffective, we had second thoughts in every action and Arsenal were, in every single aspect of the performance, better than us.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe Premier League takes a break for international football and Arsenal do not play again until 2 April when Watford visit Emirates Stadium.\nNext for Everton is a trip to Old Trafford to face Manchester United on 3 April.\nMatch ends, Everton 0, Arsenal 2.\nSecond Half ends, Everton 0, Arsenal 2.\nMohamed Elneny (Arsenal) wins a free kick in the defensive half.\nFoul by Phil Jagielka (Everton).\nAttempt missed.
