That fire has grown to more than 3,000 acres (1,200 ha) and was only 10% contained, the state department of fire protection said.\nThey are actually fairly common in intense wildfires. Here's the science: Fires obviously generate a lot of heat, and heat rises. Heated air rises even faster when surrounded by relatively cooler air on the edges of major fires, and vortexes can form in particularly strong updrafts. If those vortexes contain flame, you've got yourself a firenado.\nRead full article in Slate\nThe Legoland theme park in Carlsbad was closed due to power surges, while San Onofre nuclear power plant briefly evacuated non-essential staff as a precautionary measure.\nAnd the campus of California State University-San Marcos, with almost 10,000 students, was shut down amid the university's final exams.\nThere have already been 1,400 wildfires across the state this year, twice the usual number.\nSummary:\n",
