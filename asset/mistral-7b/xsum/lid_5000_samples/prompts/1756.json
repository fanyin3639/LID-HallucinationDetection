    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nThe measures, which took effect in April initially for one year, reduced the tariffs offered to beneficiaries of the botched green energy scheme.\nFlaws in the scheme meant it spiralled beyond its budget. At one stage it had a projected overspend of \u00a3490m.\nThe Department for the Economy has said it intends to extend the cost-control plan for a further 12 months.\nIn a statement on Wednesday, it said the extension was \"a temporary measure, which will give the department the opportunity to develop the long-term arrangements needed\".\nThe regulations were approved by MLAs just before the Northern Ireland Assembly collapsed in January.\nBut a group representing boiler owners who are claiming from the scheme began a legal challenge against the plan.\nThe Renewable Heat Association (RHANI) said in April that some of its members' firms are folding because of the cuts to their payments from the RHI scheme.\nOn Wednesday, it said scheme participants had been assured that the 2017 regulations were for a limited period.\n\"We had suspected that the announcement of the pilot or token 20 inspections was a means of distracting public attention from this deeply worrying policy decision,\" said RHANI's executive chairman Andrew Trimble.\nHe added that a previous court hearing had been told that the Department for the Economy \"did not have the lawful authority to breach the guarantees entered into when it launched the scheme\".\nRHANI's website had been busy all day, he said, as churches, charities and companies joined the organisation.\nThe new tariff rules were a one-year emergency measure to tackle a projected \u00a3490m overspend in the 20-year scheme.\nIt has been estimated that this year they will reduce the in-year overspend from \u00a330m to \u00a32m.\nNow officials have a plan to extend them for up to another 12 months.\nFor that to happen would require either assembly approval or sign-off by a direct rule minister.\nIt also assumes that a High Court challenge to the new tariff regime by boiler owners in October will be unsuccessful.\nOn Wednesday, the Department for the Economy said its cost-cutting plan had \"brought the forecast scheme expenditure back into line with the budget provided by the UK government\".\nIt added that it must wait until the court judgement on the legal challenge before it can propose a long-term measure to cut the overspend.\nIt also said there was not enough time before the end of initial one-year plan next April for a long-term solution to be proposed, consulted on and put in place.\nTherefore, it is seeking a 12-month extension - until 31 March 2019 - on the temporary regulations.\nOn Tuesday, the department announced that inspections of boiler sites are to begin.\nThe so-called \"cash-for-ash\" scandal has been the backdrop of major political upheaval in Northern Ireland over the past year.\nThe RHI scheme was set up by the Northern Ireland Executive in 2012, with the intention of increasing the consumption of fuel from renewable sources, rather than fossil fuels.\nBiomass boilers burning wood pellets were installed by most beneficiaries of the scheme.\nBut a critical flaw - an overgenerous subsidy offer - effectively allowed them to earn more cash the more fuel they burned.\nThe fallout from the scandal resulted in the collapse of the Stormont assembly and executive and the calling of a snap election in March.\nA judge-led public inquiry into the scandal has also started and is expected to hold its first public evidence sessions in September.\nSummary:\n",
