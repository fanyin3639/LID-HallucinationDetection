    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nCompanies will be watching from the sidelines with huge interest because Wales is currently more tied into the EU's single market than any other part of the UK, with the greatest proportion of our exports going there.\nFrom the late 1980s, there was an influx of investment into Wales from abroad, particularly from Japan, as foreign firms looked for a foothold in the European market.\nThose foreign firms based here will be keeping a close eye on developments, as will home-grown Welsh businesses.\nRed tape tangle?\nRhys Davies Logistics is a south Wales haulage company founded 65 years ago, before the UK joined the EU.\nBased in Taff's Well, near Cardiff, it now employs 400 staff and works across the world.\nGary Phillips, forwarding and commercial manager, said the single market has helped with deliveries, making it easier when crossing borders.\n\"Whether Yorkshire, Madrid or Paris, it's just the same,\" he said.\n\"From a logistics perspective it's made the job easier. In days gone by, pre-EU, there was an awful lot of paperwork to complete at crossings and borders.\n\"Trucks would be held up, sometimes for 24 hours. As it stands, the borders have gone, now it's not dissimilar to a UK delivery.\"\nBut dealing with countries outside the UK can cost time and money.\n\"If you take Switzerland, which isn't a member of the EU, it follows the old model.\n\"One of our vehicles could have 20 different consignments for 20 different customers, each with 20 sets of paperwork and 20 different customs declarations.\n\"If one of those is wrong, then the whole trailer can be held up at the border for 24 hours while they check every one.\"\nMr Phillips fears that outside the single market, trade with countries like Germany, France and Spain might become as difficult and as expensive as it can be with Switzerland now.\nHow much does Wales trade with the EU now?\nAbout two thirds of our exports are to the EU. Research for the Centre for Economics and Business found 200,000 jobs in Wales are indirectly dependent on them.\nAbout a quarter of Wales' exports to the EU involve machinery and transport equipment.\nAnd we import too. Globalisation has meant that many of the components in the things we buy - even a single product - come from a wide range of countries.\nSo which country is our biggest trading partner?\nAcross the UK, we export the most goods to the United States followed by Germany.\nIn Wales, Germany and France are our top export partners - with about \u00a31.7bn worth of exports in transport to Germany alone, which includes equipment for aircraft and cars.\nAnd we import the most goods, by a long way, from Germany, followed by China.\nSo trade with Germany is very important.\nAltogether, 600 Welsh firms export to the EU, while 500 firms from other European countries have operations in Wales, providing 57,000 jobs.\nMilford Haven is the UK's largest energy port, handling our trade in oil and gas. In all, it deals with 35 million tonnes of cargo a year.\nFrom the waterway, Irish Sea ferries also operate twice a day out of Pembroke to Rosslare.\nThe Port of Milford Haven chief executive Alec Don said customs operated electronically, smoothly and effectively ,so it was important to concentrate on  \"barrier free\" routes.\n\"It's in everybody's interests - Europe, UK and Wales -  that these border points don't become focuses for excessive levels of bureaucracy. They have to be kept free-moving and contributing to the economic health of the country.\"\nLooking beyond Europe\nBut there is a world outside Europe. About \u00a34bn of exports - and \u00a36.4bn of imports - involve customers outside the EU.\nSwansea-based construction firm Dawnus has plenty of work at home, including building a new school in Trimsaran, near Llanelli, and Cardiff's new \u00a357m Eastern Bay link road.\nBut since 2010, the company has also been expanding its work in west Africa, including a railway and dam projects, as well as building hydro electric schemes in Liberia and an iron ore works in Sierra Leone.\nManaging director of its international operations, Andy Peters, said: \"As Brits, we underplay our skills sometimes. If you're resilient, hardworking and professional -  and we speak English - and we're well respected in Africa.\n\"We've tapped into something that's there and British companies aren't doing that at the moment.\"\nHe hopes more support will come from the top - and he wants the UK government to promote and help business open up new markets.\n\"They can give soft loans to friendly governments to spend with British companies on infrastructure which will be game-changing projects for their countries.\n\"We need the work, they need the infrastructure - and we can provide life-changing opportunities for our young people as well.\"\nWhat the parties are saying on trade\nThe Conservatives would seek a \"deep and special partnership\", including comprehensive free trade and customs agreements, and seek to replicate all existing EU free trade agreements.\nLabour would scrap the Conservatives' Brexit White Paper and replace with \"fresh negotiating priorities\" with strong emphasis on retaining the benefits of the single market and customs union.\nThe Liberal Democrats pledge membership of the single market and customs union.\nPlaid Cymru wants all future trade deals endorsed by the National Assembly.\nUKIP is publishing its manifesto next week but is pledging a \"full Brexit\" and control of borders.\nThe Green Partyis also to publish its manifesto but is promising to keep Britain \"close to our European neighbours\" and a second referendum if voters do not like the government's Brexit deal.\nBrexit is one of the key issues in this election and there is much talk about what type of trading relationship we might or might not have.\nPolitical parties are not giving us the detail of what deal they would make.
