    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nThe four-storey, 95,000 sq ft (8,825 sq m) Heritage Transport Museum, located off a highway near the capital, Delhi, showcases the evolution of various forms of transport in India. The collection has been mainly put together from contributions of private donors.\nThe museum features cars that have been used in India since the advent of motoring. On display are over 75 vintage and classic cars.\nThe cars are parked alongside a recreated Indian street scene from yesteryears.\nOn display is the Ambassador, the first car to be made in India. Modelled on the Morris Oxford, the design of the Ambassador has changed little since it first went into production in 1957.  Earlier this year, the manufacturer halted production of the car,     blaming weak demand and financing problems.\n\"Oddly, in the sea of glimmering metal here, a 1935 Buick Series Limousine stands out for its decrepit state,\" wrote a reviewer for a leading automobile magazine, while reviewing the museum.\nThe improvised four-seater auto-rickshaw, locally called \"phatphati\", continues to run in parts of the capital's old city. The ornate, vintage ones are built out of old Harley Davidson motorcycles.\nThe humble pedal-driven cycle rickshaw is still used as a mode of transport over short distances in a number of Indian cities and towns.\nOn display are also locally-made indigenous forms of motorised transport, like this tempo which has been improvised to carry passengers.\nA 1946 Piper aircraft also finds a pride of place in the museum. These yellow-painted, light aircraft were built between 1937 and 1947 mainly for flight training.\nPalanquins, bullock carts, horse carriages and camel carts were among the earliest forms of transport in India and some of them can still be seen in rural India. The museum has a collection of bullock carts.\nSummary:\n",
