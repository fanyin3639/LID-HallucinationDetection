    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nJames Weatherup, 59, told a jury  that intercepting voicemails was part of the \"day-to-day\" life at the publication.\nThe ex-news editor at the now defunct paper also claimed phone hacking was discussed at editorial conferences.\nMr Coulson, 47, denies lying while giving evidence at the 2010 perjury trial of Tommy Sheridan in Glasgow.\nMr Weatherup was giving evidence on the seventh day of the trial at the High Court in Edinburgh.\nHe told the court that he was appointed to the post of news editor in 2004 when Mr Coulson was the editor.\nThe witness pleaded guilty to a charge of phone hacking in 2013 and was given a four month suspended sentence, the court heard.\nMr Weatherup told the court that, a few days into his new role at the paper, he was asked to cut its budget and began to question a payment made to private investigator Glenn Mulcaire's company, Nine Consultancy.\nThe salary was about \u00c2\u00a392,000 - more than the reporters were paid, the witness told the court.\nAsked by advocate depute Richard Goddard, prosecuting, if he inquired who was getting the money, he replied: \"I was told it was a private investigator called Glenn Mulcaire and I had to work with him.\"\nHe said managing editor Stuart Kuttner made the comment to him.\nOn the payment to the consultancy, which Mr Weatherup described as a \"huge sum\", he said: \"I didn't see the point of having a private investigator being paid full-time for things.\n\"If you needed things done I thought it would be better and cheaper to be done ad hoc.\"\nThe witness said he later raised the issue with Mr Coulson in his office and told him \"we didn't need Glenn Mulcaire on the payroll\".\nMr Weatherup said Mr Coulson told him to \"see Stuart\". The witness insisted \"there was no appetite to get rid of him (Mulcaire) by senior management\".\nMr Weatherup said he himself was not aware initially but soon found out that Mr Mulcaire \"was a phone hacker\" and had used his services 137 times, but not all for phone hacking.\nMr Goddard asked Mr Weatherup: \"From what you yourself witnessed, did Mr Coulson appear to be aware or not that Mr Mulcaire was hacking phones?\"\n\"Hacking phones was systematic at the News of the World,\" he replied.\n\"Did Mr Coulson appear or not to know that Mr Mulcaire was hacking phones?\"\n\"Andy would have known that Mulcaire was hacking phones,\" the witness replied.\nThe journalist also said that he told Mr Coulson that stories had been obtained from hacking phones.\nTelling the court that he would make a telephone gesture with his hands, Mr Weatherup added: \"I would have used a signal with my hands when Andy asked me where a story had came from.\"\nMr Goddard was also asked if Mr Coulson would have known about how stories were sourced and said: \"All editors are concerned about sourcing, yeah. He needed to know where a story had come from.\"\nWhen Mr Coulson's advocate, Murdo Macleod QC, asked Mr Weatherup whether his evidence was \"nonsense,\" the journalist replied: \"I have no reason to lie. I feel sorry for Andy. I feel for his wife. I feel sorry for his children. I have no reason to tell lies.\"\nLater, when Mr Goddard asked Mr Weatherup how he felt about claims that he had lied in his evidence, the former executive added that he had come to court reluctantly.\nHe added: \"I would say it was a gross slur on my character and it's not true.\n\"I have not come here to lie. I have come here to tell the truth reluctantly.\n\"I don't want to be here. I want put all of this behind me but it just comes back to haunt me.\"\nThe charge against Mr Coulson alleges that he lied in court when he appeared as a witness at Mr Sheridan's perjury trial and that before August 2006 he did know about phone hacking, did know or know of a private investigator Glenn Mulcaire and did know about payments by the newspaper to corrupt police officers.\nThe trial before Lord Burns continues.\nSummary:\n",
