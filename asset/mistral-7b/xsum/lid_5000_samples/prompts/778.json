The worker who caught it was labelled a fool.\nThe main event starts when the hood is thrown into the middle of the scrum, or sway, as it is known locally.\nThe sway pushes through the villages, with each team trying to direct it towards their pub.\nThe contest ends when the Hood is touched by the landlord of the winning team's pub.\nSummary:\n",
