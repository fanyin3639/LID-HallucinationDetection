    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nJohn Margetts, at a Bristol branch of Optical Express, made the claim to a reporter working for Inside Out West.\nIt was criticised by an eye expert who said Mr Margetts had given \"deliberately false information\".\nThe RAF said Mr Margetts' claim was not true. He said he was not told to make the claim by Optical Express.\nHe added that he used to serve in the RAF.\nIn a statement, Optical Express said its \"strict policy\" was that clinicians must \"fully disclose the risks, benefits, potential outcomes and alternatives of procedures to all patients\".\nDuring the undercover filming at the Cabot Circus branch, Mr Margetts was asked if the procedure was \"100% safe\".\nHe replied: \"Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah.\"\nHe also made claims to the BBC reporter that fighter pilots were required to have laser eye surgery.\nMr Margetts added: \"The new visor systems where you can see 40 miles away, the laser tracking systems that shine off your corneas, mustn't have a parallax error.\n\"So you have to be lasered to match the visor, so it's now called a biometric enhancement.\"\nMr Margetts said he must have \"mis-heard\" the question about whether the treatment was 100% safe. He added that he always explained the potential risks of the procedure.\nOptical Express provides written information about the risks involved in the procedure - which are also mentioned in the video shown to customers.\nIt said that the undercover reporter did not complete the informed consent process, which would \"also have included an examination and discussion with the surgeon as well as confirming in person and in writing that all risks had been understood\".\nBBC West health correspondent Matthew Hill\nRob Johnston, of Cheltenham General Hospital, said: \"Clearly stating that any surgical procedure is 100% safe is not true.\n\"Some patients are unhappy after surgical procedures for a whole variety of reasons, minor or more serious, and that should be explained to them.\"\nHayes and Harlington MP John McDonnell, has campaigned for more regulation, which Optical Express says they support.  He said the footage was \"shocking\".\n\"The high street providers, the government tells us are regulated by the CQC [Care Quality Commission] and the ASA [Advertising Standards Authority] but as your filming shows and as so many other examples show, that regulation just isn't working.\"\nThe film about Optical Express will be on Inside Out West on BBC One on 7 September at 19:30 BST and afterwards on the iPlayer.\nSummary:\n",
