    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nThe Manchester United maestro lined up with another sporting legend, Kerry kingpin Jack O'Shea, for this image captured at a unique event at a Castleblayney hotel.\nA similar one was posted on social media by Anthony Loughman, the young boy being cradled, far right, in the arms of his cousin Declan, following Monaghan's recent Ulster Championship triumph over Donegal.\nDeclan had played for Monaghan in the 1988 final against Tyrone and his father Tony, a music promotions entrepreneur who represented the county in the 1960s, secured the appearance of Best and O'Shea.\nIt was organised as a summer showcase for Declan's sports goods firm and he said the fear was that George wouldn't turn up.\n\"My dad organised the visit of George Best through his agent. It was a shock that he landed, people were telling me there was not a chance,\" he said.\n\"We didn't think he would be available.\n\"George and Jack O'Shea got on the best, he was very approachable.\n\"The place was packed, there were hundreds there, and he got a great reception, it was buzzing.\"\nJack O'Shea told BBC News NI that he had admired Best's skills as a childhood Manchester United supporter, but never thought he would get the chance to meet him.\nThe seven-time All-Ireland title winner had dinner with the Old Trafford icon and was able to witness his magnetism at close quarters.\nFor one evening only, the masters of balance from Cregagh and Cahersiveen, would meet on the level.\n\"It was just great to be in George's company, we had dinner and we talked about sport and preparing for games,\" Jack said.\n\"George talked about the importance of expressing yourself when playing, respecting your opponent but having the confidence about what you can do yourself.\n\"He also talked about his career with Manchester United. He was charismatic, very approachable and sociable, he was easy to talk to and relate to.\n\"When he was in the function room, it was an electric atmosphere, people were all around him, he was like a magnet.\n\"I am a Manchester United fan, I never thought I was going to meet him so it was a huge occasion for me.\"\nThe picture also triggered memories for Emmet McAviney, who attended the event with his father John - a well-known photographer in the Monaghan area.\nJohn McAviney passed away in December 2009, leaving behind thousands of images that are now being digitised by Emmet. His bedroom walls were once adorned with the sporting personalities his father snapped.\nAmong them, several of the Clones Cyclone, boxer Barry McGuigan, whose 1985 world championship triumph against Eusebio Pedroza at Loftus Road in London, John attended.\nThe night George met Jack has even more significance for Emmet, now he is a father.\n\"There was real excitement going to meet these guys and I got my photograph taken with both George Best and Jack O'Shea,\" he said.\n\"I was a Manchester United fan and it was a big thrill to meet George, who was there with his son Calum.\n\"Actually I came across the photograph of myself with George in recent years and was able to show it to my son.\n\"He is 11, the same age I was when I met George.
