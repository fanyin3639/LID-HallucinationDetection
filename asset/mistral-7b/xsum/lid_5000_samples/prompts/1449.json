        "Scotland's domestic season is under way, while its four European representatives had an even earlier start, and the revolving doors have been in motion as squads have been dismantled, rebuilt or merely tweaked."
    ],
    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nRangers, after a disappointing third-place finish last season, have been the biggest spenders as they try to narrow the gap between themselves and champions Celtic.\nPortugal defender Bruno Alves is their most high-profile signing, from Cagliari, as manager Pedro Caixinha begins to turn Ibrox into Glasgow's Latin quarter.\nCeltic manager Brendan Rodgers appears fairly content with the squad that won the club's sixth title in a row, but they have once again made the single biggest acquisition, with French midfielder Olivier Ntcham arriving from Manchester City in exchange for \u00a34.5m.\nSome of Scotland's best emerging talent has headed across the border to English football - Hibernian striker Jason Cummings and Rangers winger Barrie McKay to Nottingham Forest, right-back Calum Paterson from Hearts to Cardiff City, centre-half Liam Lindsay from Partick Thistle to Barnsley, while teen midfielder Billy Gilmour had not even established himself with Rangers before being sold to Chelsea.\nThe league's top scorer, Northern Ireland striker Liam Boyce, was also sold, by Ross County to Burton Albion.\nThey have been replaced with some well-known faces returning to the Scottish top-flight, albeit the wrong side of 30 - Iceland defender Kari Arnason to Aberdeen, Northern Ireland striker Kyle Lafferty and Scotland defender Christophe Berra to Hearts, former Norwich City duo Graham Dorrans and Steven Whittaker to Rangers and Hibs respectively, while former Ibrox defender Kirk Broadfoot and Scotland international Gordon Greer joined Kilmarnock.\nTeam rebuilding couldn't prevent Rangers and St Johnstone making ignominious exits at the first stage of Europa League qualifying, while Aberdeen fell two rounds later and Kilmarnock kicked-off the domestic season with a surprise League Cup defeat by third-tier Ayr United.\nWhile Motherwell and Rangers have been the busiest in the transfer market, it took until the day before they opened the season against East Kilbride for Hamilton Academical to make their first addition - although defender Xavier Tomas' arrival from Lausanne-Sport was the first time they had paid a transfer fee in eight years.\nThere's obviously more work to be done before the transfer window closes at the end of August.\nWe asked BBC pundit Allan Preston, a man who knows the player agency world inside out, to assess how the clubs have recruited this season and where they might make further signings.\nPreston's report card: Jonny Hayes and Niall McGinn were a massive loss to Aberdeen, but Derek McInnes has signed really well once again and added some good players, such as Greg Stewart on loan and Gary Mackay-Steven.\nKey signing: Ryan Christie coming back for a second loan spell from Celtic is especially good business and, now that he knows he will be at Pittodrie for another year, he seems to have the bit between his teeth.\nAugust targets: Aberdeen still need another big right-sided centre-half, although Kari Arnason has returned and could be that guy.\nIn: Gary Mackay-Steven, midfielder (Celtic, undisclosed); Kari Arnason, defender (Omonia Nicosia); Greg Tansey, midfielder (Inverness Caledonian Thistle); Nicky Maynard, forward (MK Dons). Loan: Greg Stewart, forward (Birmingham City); Ryan Christie, midfielder (Celtic).\nOut: Jonny Hayes, midfielder (Celtic, \u00a31.3m); Ryan Jack, midfielder (Rangers); Niall McGinn, forward (Gwangju); Ash Taylor, defender (Northampton Town); Peter Pawlett, midfielder (MK Dons); Neil Alexander, goalkeeper (Livingston); Cammy Smith, forward (St Mirren); Aaron Lennox, goalkeeper (Raith Rovers); Robbie Mutch, goalkeeper (Falkirk); Jamie Henry, midfielder (Arbroath); Lawrence Shankland, forward; Joe Nuttall, forward; Jamie Henry, forward; Dylan Thomas, midfielder; Aaron Norris, midfielder.\nManager: Derek McInnes (appointed March 2013)\nLast season: 2nd\nClive's prediction: 3rd. While they have lost some flair, the Dons probably now have a better squad and, while that won't be enough to eat enough into the large gap between themselves and likely champions Celtic, it will ensure a close battle for second with a heavily financed Rangers.\nPreston's report card: Celtic at one stage last season had 31-32 players in their first-team squad, which is far too many. Brendan Rodgers has gradually whittled it down this summer while bringing in a couple of players of quality.\nKey signing: I've watched Olivier Ntcham emerge as a youngster with Manchester City and is a very good player. He will be an excellent addition to the Celtic midfield.\nAugust targets: Rodgers is right to say that Celtic can't afford to have three top-class strikers - not because of the cost but because you can't have a good player sitting kicking his heels. However, with Leigh Griffiths and Moussa Dembele having some injury problems, he would probably like to add a wide man who can deputise up front from time to time, like Patrick Roberts did last season.\nIn: Olivier Ntcham, midfielder (Manchester City, \u00a34.5m); Jonny Hayes, midfielder (Aberdeen, \u00a31.3m); Kundai Benyu, midfielder (Ipswich Town, compensation).\nOut: Emilio Izaguirre, defender (Al-Fayha, undisclosed); Efe Ambrose, defender (Hibernian); Gary Mackay-Steven, midfielder (Aberdeen, undisclosed); Saidy Janko, defender (St Etienne); Logan Bailly, goalkeeper (Mouscron); Paul McMullan, midfielder (Dundee United); Eoghan O'Connell, defender (Bury); Fiacre Kelleher, defender (Oxford United); Conor McManus, midfielder (Greenock Morton); Kris Commons, midfielder; Leo Fasan, goalkeeper; Luke Donnelly, forward. Loan ended: Patrick Roberts, midfielder (Manchester City). Loan: Scott Allan, midfielder (Dundee); Sam Wardrop, defender (Dumbarton).\nManager: Brendan Rodgers (appointed May 2016)\nLast season: 1st\nClive's prediction: 1st. It is probably too much to expect Celtic to go on another unbeaten domestic season. However, they obviously feel confident enough that they can secure yet another title without having to break the bank.\nPreston's report card: Neil McCann has stayed on after his short spell at the end of last season, has made a number of signings and the foreign guys will take a bit of time to settle. Jack Hendry looks a good addition to the defence and Scott Allan, who lost his way a bit at Rotherham and Celtic, should be a good signing if he recovers the excellent form he showed with Hibs.\nKey signing: Being unable to find a good enough replacement for Kane Hemmings and Greg Stewart was costly for previous Dens boss Paul Hartley and it is not easy with the budget available to most Scottish clubs to find a consistent goalscorer. But Sofien Moussa seems like a bit of a handful, has already started scoring goals and could fit the bill if McCann can keep him healthy and hungry.\nAugust targets: With Julen Etxabeguren still out injured and James McPake being a long-term absentee, Dundee possibly need to add one more defender.\nIn: Glen Kamara, midfielder (Arsenal); Randy Wolters, midfielder (Go Ahead Eagles); Sofien Moussa, forward (Lokomotiv Gorna); Jack Hendry, defender (Wigan Athletic); Lewis Spence, midfielder (Dunfermline Athletic); Elliot Parish, goalkeeper (Accrington Stanley); Roarie Deacon, midfielder (Sutton United). Loan: Scott Allan, midfielder (Celtic).\nOut: Rory Loy, forward (Falkirk); Kevin Gomis, defender; Nick Ross, midfielder; Daniel Higgins, defender (Kilmarnock); Yordi Teijsse, forward (Quick Boys); David Mitchell, goalkeeper (Falkirk); Josh Skelly, forward (Arbroath); Matty Allan, defender (Montrose); Calvin Colquhoun, midfielder; Kyle Clark, midfielder. Loan ended: Henrik Ojamaa, forward (Go Ahead Eagles). Loan: Conor Quigley, defender (Forfar Athletic); Ian Smith, forward (Edinburgh City).\nManager: Neil McCann (appointed April 2017)\nLast season: 10th\nClive's prediction: 8th. Sofien Moussa will find the Premiership harder going than the League Cup, but his five goals in four games so far suggest the Tunisian striker could be the man to keep Dundee clear of relegation trouble.\nPreston's report card: Hamilton's philosophy is to develop players, promote them to their first team and sell them on. They might get relegated as a result, but their philosophy does not change. They believe they have 20-25 youngsters behind the scenes that have a chance to break through and that's why they have only made two signings so far this summer.\nKey signing: Central defender Xavier Tomas is an unknown quantity, but Ryan Fulton is a young Scottish goalkeeper they have high hopes for - and, if Hamilton are going to stay in the Premiership, they need a goalkeeper who is consistently good.\nAugust targets: With captain Michael Devlin, a terrific player, being out long term, they might look to bring in another defender.\nIn: Xavier Tomas, defender (Lausanne-Sport, undisclosed); Ryan Fulton, goalkeeper (Liverpool).\nOut: Gramoz Kurtaj, midfielder (SHB-Da Nang); Blair Adams, defender (Hartlepool United); Craig Watson, defender (East Fife); Jack Breslin, defender (Clyde); Richard Roy, forward (Broughty Ferry); Alex D'Acol, forward; Jesus Garcia Tena, defender; Danny Seaborne, defender. Loan ended: Remi Matthews, goalkeeper (Norwich City).\nManager: Martin Canning (appointed January 2015)\nLast season: 11th\nClive's prediction: 12th. With just about every club strengthening this summer, Accies will be doing well to avoid automatic relegation unless a few gems emerge quickly from their lauded youth system to save them.\nPreston's report card: Hearts have recruited players of undeniable ability, with Christophe Berra, Kyle Lafferty and Rafal Grzelak being current internationals. I worry about the lack of pace in their defence, but the nucleus of the squad is good. What they lacked under Ian Cathro was a manager who is able to motivate them.\nKey signing: It is a big season for Kyle Lafferty. With Northern Ireland looking to qualify for the World Cup finals, the striker needs to be playing regularly and scoring goals.\nRemaining targets: Hearts need someone with experience to challenge Jack Hamilton. The young man will be a good goalkeeper, but he has been struggling in a struggling team and I believe Hearts are looking at bringing in Freddie Woodman, who did well with Kilmarnock last season, on loan from Newcastle. With Jamie Walker not playing amid doubts about his future at the club, they also need a wide player.\nIn: Kyle Lafferty, forward (Norwich City); Christophe Berra, defender (Ipswich Town); Rafal Grzelak, defender (Korona Kielce); Michael Smith, defender (Peterborough United, nominal); Cole Stockton, forward (Tranmere Rovers). Loan: Connor Randall, midfielder (Liverpool); Ashley Smith-Brown, defender (Manchester City).\nOut: Ian Cathro, head coach: Bjorn Johnsen, forward (ADO Den Haag, undisclosed); Callum Paterson, defender (Cardiff City, undisclosed); Perry Kitchen, midfielder (Randers); Sam Nicholson, midfielder (Minnesota United); Faycal Rherras, defender (Mechelen); Gavin Reilly, forward (St Mirren); Billy King, midfielder (Dundee United); Robbie Buchanan, forward (Cowdenbeath); Alexandros Tziolis, midfielder; Andraz Struna, defender; Tasos Avlonitis, defender; Juwon Oshaniwa, defender; Dylan Bikey, forward; Dale Baxter, midfielder. Loan ended: Moha Choulay, midfielder (Stoke City). Loan: Nikolay Todorov, forward (Livingston); Ally Roy, forward (Dumbarton); Harry Paton, midfielder (Stenhousemuir); Andrew Irving, midfielder (Berwick Rangers); Callum Morrison, midfielder (Stirling Albion).\nHead coach (interim): Jon Daly (appointed August 2017)\nLast season: 5th\nClive's prediction: 7th. Much will depend on who comes in to replace Ian Cathro - and how quickly. But being forced to play so many games at the start of the season away from home because of the new Tynecastle stand may be enough of a handicap from which they never fully recover.\nPreston's report card: Hibs have signed well this summer and brought in the likes of Steven Whittaker, a versatile player with international pedigree. Neil Lennon's problem will be deciding what his best 11 is.\nKey signing: It will be interesting to see if Simon Murray can prove himself at Premiership level. The former Dundee United striker has certainly hit the ground running in the League Cup.\nAugust targets: Bringing Anthony Stokes, another quality striker, back to the club will be the final piece of the jigsaw for Lennon.\nIn: Vykintas Slivka, midfielder (Juventus, undisclosed); Efe Ambrose, defender (Celtic); Ofir Marciano, goalkeeper (Ashdod, undisclosed); Danny Swanson, midfielder (St Johnstone); Deivydas Matulevicius, forward (Royal Mouscron); Steven Whittaker, defender (Norwich City); Anthony Stokes, forward (Blackburn Rovers); Simon Murray, forward (Dundee United).\nOut: Jason Cummings, forward (Nottingham Forest, undisclosed); James Keatings, forward (Dundee United); Fraser Fyvie, midfielder (Dundee United); Chris Humphrey, midfielder (Bury); Jordon Forster, defender (Cheltenham Town); Alex Harris, midfielder (Falkirk); Danny Handling, forward (Dumbarton); Scott Gallacher, goalkeeper (Dumbarton); Aaron Dunsmore, defender (Elgin City); Grant Holt, forward; Brian McLean, defender; Jamie Insall, forward. Loan: Sam Stanton, midfielder (Dundee United); Callum Donaldson, defender (Berwick Rangers); Kevin Waugh, defender (Berwick Rangers); Lewis Allan, forward (Edinburgh City); Sean Mackie, defender (Edinburgh City).\nHead coach: Neil Lennon (June 2016)\nLast season: 1st, Championship\nClive's prediction: 4th. Even Rangers found the transition from Championship title winners to top-six contenders difficult last season, but Hibs have already shown they can compete with the best in cup ties last term and have added some players of undoubted quality.\nPreston's report card: Kilmarnock now have a proper manager in place with Lee McCulloch and he has recruited some good experience in Kirk Broadfoot and fellow defender Gordon Greer, who will be an excellent signing if he can play enough at the age of 36 on a 3G pitch that saps your legs.\nKey signing: It was a surprise that Motherwell let Dom Thomas go. The winger maybe got the jolt he needed by being sent out on loan to Queen of the South and has been on fire at the start of the season.\nAugust targets: Killie need someone to play up front along with Kris Boyd and play in behind him. They had Conor Sammon last season on loan and might hope they can get him again from Hearts. I expect they will also hope young defender Kristoffer Ajer returns on loan from Celtic.\nIn: Chris Burke, midfielder (Ross County); Gordon Greer, defender (Blackburn Rovers); Kirk Broadfoot, defender (Rotherham United); Lee Erwin, forward (Leeds United); Cammy Bell, goalkeeper (Dundee United); Alex Samizadeh, forward (Bolton Wanderers); Dom Thomas, midfielder (Motherwell); Stephen O'Donnell, defender (Luton Town); Calum Waters, defender (Alloa Athletic); Daniel Higgins, defender (Dundee); Alan Power, midfielder (Lincoln City).\nOut: Aaron Splaine, midfielder (Dunfermline Athletic); Lewis Morrison, forward (St Mirren); Dapo Kayode, defender; Jack Whittaker, midfielder (Cowdenbeath); Jamie Cobain, defender. Loan ended: Kristoffer Ajer, midfielder (Celtic); Conor Sammon, forward (Hearts); Josh Umerah, forward (Charlton Athletic).\nManager: Lee McCulloch (appointed January 2016)\nLast season: 8th\nClive's prediction: 6th. Lee McCulloch has added some old heads to his squad that can only suggest a higher league position than last season.\nPreston's report card: Motherwell have lost the leadership of Keith Lasley in midfield as he has turned to coaching and will hope that their summer additions have also plugged a weakness in central defence after taking a couple of hammerings last season. But Stephen Robinson has signed some decent players and they have had a good League Cup campaign.\nKey signing: Chris Cadden can provide from midfield and Louis Moult can score, so the most important thing for Motherwell this summer is to hold on to both. Aberdeen made an attempt to buy Moult and it is imperative that Motherwell keep him if they are to have a reasonable season.\nAugust targets: With the departure of Scott McDonald, I imagine they will be looking for another striker to play alongside Moult.\nIn: Cedric Kipre, defender (Leicester City); Ellis Plummer, defender (Manchester City); Alex Fisher, forward (Inverness Caledonian Thistle); Russell Griffiths, goalkeeper (Everton); Craig Tanner, midfielder (Reading); Gael Bigirimana, midfielder (Coventry City); Andy Rose, midfielder (Coventry City); Charles Dunne, defender (Oldham Athletic); Trevor Carson, goalkeeper (Hartlepool United); George Newell, forward (Bolton Wanderers); Dylan King, defender (Oldham Athletic); Liam Brown, midfielder (Queen's Park).\nOut: Dom Thomas, midfielder (Kilmarnock); Scott McDonald, forward (Dundee United); Craig Samson, goalkeeper (St Mirren); Lionel Ainsworth, midfielder (Plymouth Argyle); Joe Chalmers, defender (Inverness Caledonian Thistle); Keith Lasley, midfielder (retired); Craig Clay, midfielder (Leyton Orient); Dylan Mackin, forward (Livingston); Craig Moore, forward (Ayr United); David Ferguson, midfielder (Ayr United); James McFadden, forward; Stephen Pearson, midfielder; Lee Lucas, midfielder; Tom Fry, midfielder; Jordan Pettigrew, goalkeeper. Loan ended: Zak Jules, defender (Reading); Oliver Pain, goalkeeper (Sunderland).\nManager: Stephen Robinson (appointed March 2017)\nLast season: 9th\nClive's prediction: 10th. Northern Irishman Stephen Robinson has built a little English enclave at Fir Park as he has recruited from leagues down south he knows best. League Cup results suggest his side have improved, but they might just find that others have improved more.\nPreston's report card: Thistle have been relatively quiet in the transfer market, but Alan Archibald still has the nucleus of a very good squad. He has brought in Jordan Turnbull, who is a very good footballer, from Coventry City, while Blair Spittal has started the season well having lost his way in a struggling Dundee United side.\nKey signing: Liam Lindsay has gone to Barnsley, but he is a different kind of player to Turnbull. Lindsay is a strong centre-half, but Turnbull is a lovely passer of the ball.\nAugust targets: Thistle have lost Mustapha Dumbuya for several months through injury, so another right-back was Archibald's priority and he has brought in Milan Nitriansky, who last played with Bohemians 1905 in the Czech top flight.\nIn: Milan Nitriansky, defender (Bohemians 1905); Niall Keown, defender (Reading, undisclosed); Blair Spittal, midfielder (Dundee United); Jamie Sneddon, goalkeeper (Cowdenbeath). Loan: Jordan Turnbull, defender (Coventry City).\nOut: Liam Lindsay, defender (Barnsley, undisclosed); Mark Ridgers, goalkeeper (Inverness Caledonian Thistle); Ade Azeez, forward (Cambridge United); David Amoo, midfielder (Cambridge United); David Wilson, midfielder (Dumbarton); Michael McMullin, defender (Albion Rovers); Dominic Docherty, midfielder (Queen's Park); Matthew McInally, defender (Cowdenbeath); Sean Welsh, midfielder; Conor Cullen, goalkeeper; Jamie Hall, midfielder; Struan Herd, goalkeeper. Loan ended: Jason Banton, midfielder (Crawley Town).\nManager: Alan Archibald (appointed January 2013)\nLast season: 6th\nClive's prediction: 11th. Archibald's Thistle defied predictions last season with a top-six finish, but the margins between sixth and bottom six were so fine that the Maryhill mob might find they are in a struggle at the bottom again due to their inferior playing budget.\nPreston's report card: Pedro Caixinha has had a massive turnover of players and Ryan Jack is a good signing. Although Rangers have paid money for them, I am not sure what some of the foreign players will bring, especially when it comes to a cold November night in Dingwall.\nKey signing: Bruno Alves should be a positive influence because of his class and standing in the game, although the Portugal centre-half is 35 years old now.\nAugust targets: Rangers have shown interest in Aberdeen's Kenny McLean and Hearts' Jamie Walker and might pursue those. Meanwhile, Kenny Miller is like old father time and just keeps going, but Rangers need a striker capable of taking over from him as they can't keep relying on a 37-year-old if new signings Alfredo Morelos and Eduardo Herrera can't displace him.\nIn: Bruno Alves, defender (Cagliari, undisclosed); Graham Dorrans, midfielder (Norwich City, undisclosed); Alfredo Morelos, forward (HJK Helsinki, undisclosed); Ryan Jack, midfielder (Aberdeen); Fabio Cardoso, defender (Vitoria Setubal, undisclosed); Daniel Candeias, midfielder (Benfica, undisclosed); Carlos Pena, midfielder (Guadalajara, undisclosed); Eduardo Herrera, forward (Pumas, undisclosed). Loan: Dalcio, midfielder (Benfica).\nOut: Barrie McKay, midfielder (Nottingham Forest, \u00a3500,000); Joe Garner, forward (Ipswich Town, undisclosed); Rob Kiernan, defender (Southend United, undisclosed); Matt Crooks, midfielder (Northampton Town, undisclosed); Billy Gilmour, midfielder (Chelsea, undisclosed); Philippe Senderos, defender; Clint Hill, defender; Max Ashmore, midfielder; Jordan Gibson, forward; Amin Bouzaig, forward; Sam Jamieson, forward; Josh Jeffries, midfielder. Loan ended: Emerson Hyndman, midfielder (Bournemouth); Jon Toral, midfielder (Arsenal). Loan: Andy Halliday, midfielder (Gabala), Michael O'Halloran, midfielder (St Johnstone); Robby McCrorie, goalkeeper (Berwick Rangers); Kyle Bradley, defender (Clyde).\nManager: Pedro Caixinha (appointed March 2017)\nLast season: 3rd\nClive's prediction: 2nd. With the amount of money Pedro Caixinha has been allowed to spend this summer, the Portuguese coach will find his position untenable unless Rangers finish second and narrow the gap between themselves and prospective champions Celtic. But they will face a tough fight to even wrest the runners-up spot from Aberdeen.\nPreston's report card: Ross County had a decent end to last season but have now lost the league's top scorer after Liam Boyce was sold to Burton Albion. We know Dingwall's not the end of the earth, but people down south seem to think it is and County often have to pay more to persuade players to go there, but they have managed to sign Billy Mckay as a replacement.\nKey signing: County will hope that Mckay can rediscover the form he showed in his first spell with Inverness after less productive times at Wigan, Dundee United and back at Caley Thistle.\nAugust targets: Mckay is a different type of striker to fellow Northern Ireland international Boyce and is more of a runner, so County might also look to bring in someone with more physical presence in central midfield to compensate.\nIn: Billy Mckay, forward (Wigan Athletic, undisclosed); Thomas Mikkelsen, forward (Odense); Sean Kelly, defender (AFC Wimbledon); Jim O'Brien, midfielder (Shrewsbury Town, loan to permanent); Tom Grivosti, defender (Bolton Wanderers). Loan: Jamie Lindsay, midfielder (Celtic).\nOut: Liam Boyce, forward (Burton Albion, undisclosed); Chris Burke, midfielder (Kilmarnock); Ian McShane, midfielder (St Mirren); Chris McLaughlin, defender (Dumbarton); David Brownlie, defender (Airdrieonians); Paul Quinn, defender; Jay McEveley, defender; Jonathan Franks, forward; Oscar Gobern, midfielder; Matt Hall, defender. Loan ended: Milan Lalkovic, midfielder (Portsmouth). Loan: Mark Foden, goalkeeper (Stirling Albion).\nManager: Jim McIntyre (appointed September 2014)\nLast season: 7th\nClive's prediction: 8th. Without chief marksman Liam Boyce, who was the Premiership's top scorer last season with 23 goals, County will find it more difficult to avoid the battle against relegation.\nPreston's report card: Tommy Wright will hope to again keep St Johnstone in the top six with a minimum of squad changes. Saints will miss Danny Swanson for his goals and ability on the ball, but they will hope that new signing Stefan Scougall can provide that from midfield.\nKey signing: Bringing Michael O'Halloran back from Rangers is a good piece of business considering three or four other clubs were interested and it would be a surprise if he was not back scoring goals now that he is under Wright's wing again.\nAugust targets: Steven Anderson is getting on in age and I would imagine Saints would be looking to bring in another centre-half as cover, or someone who can fill in across the back.\nIn: Stefan Scougall, midfielder (Sheffield United); Callum Hendry, forward (Blackburn Rovers); Kyle McClean, midfielder (Nottingham Forest); Scott Tanser, defender (Port Vale). Loan: Michael O'Halloran, midfielder (Rangers).\nOut: Danny Swanson, midfielder (Hibernian); Tam Scobbie, defender (Dundee United); Connor McLaren, forward (Montrose); George Hunter, forward; Eoghan McCawl, midfielder. Loan: Greg Hurst, forward (East Fife).\nManager: Tommy Wright (appointed June 2013)\nLast season: 4th\nClive's prediction: 5th. St Johnstone keep punching above their weight, but yet another season finishing fourth might just be beyond them thanks to the return of Hibs.\nSummary:\n",

With Northern Ireland looking to qualify for the World Cup finals, the striker needs to be playing regularly and scoring goals.\nRemaining targets: Hearts need someone with experience to challenge Jack Hamilton. The young man will be a good goalkeeper, but he has been struggling in a struggling team and I believe Hearts are looking at bringing in Freddie Woodman, who did well with Kilmarnock last season, on loan from Newcastle. With Jamie Walker not playing amid doubts about his future at the club, they also need a wide player.\nIn: Kyle Lafferty, forward (Norwich City); Christophe Berra, defender (Ipswich Town); Rafal Grzelak, defender (Korona Kielce); Michael Smith, defender (Peterborough United, nominal); Cole Stockton, forward (Tranmere Rovers). Loan: Connor Randall, midfielder (Liverpool); Ashley Smith-Brown, defender (Manchester City).\nOut: Ian Cathro, head coach: Bjorn Johnsen, forward (ADO Den Haag, undisclosed); Callum Paterson, defender (Cardiff City, undisclosed); Perry Kitchen, midfielder (Randers); Sam Nicholson, midfielder (Minnesota United); Faycal Rherras, defender (Mechelen); Gavin Reilly, forward (St Mirren); Billy King, midfielder (Dundee United); Robbie Buchanan, forward (Cowdenbeath); Alexandros Tziolis, midfielder; Andraz Struna, defender; Tasos Avlonitis, defender; Juwon Oshaniwa, defender; Dylan Bikey, forward; Dale Baxter, midfielder. Loan ended: Moha Choulay, midfielder (Stoke City). Loan: Nikolay Todorov, forward (Livingston); Ally Roy, forward (Dumbarton); Harry Paton, midfielder (Stenhousemuir); Andrew Irving, midfielder (Berwick Rangers); Callum Morrison, midfielder (Stirling Albion).\nHead coach (interim): Jon Daly (appointed August 2017)\nLast season: 5th\nClive's prediction: 7th. Much will depend on who comes in to replace Ian Cathro - and how quickly. But being forced to play so many games at the start of the season away from home because of the new Tynecastle stand may be enough of a handicap from which they never fully recover.\nPreston's report card: Hibs have signed well this summer and brought in the likes of Steven Whittaker, a versatile player with international pedigree. Neil Lennon's problem will be deciding what his best 11 is.\nKey signing: It will be interesting to see if Simon Murray can prove himself at Premiership level. The former Dundee United striker has certainly hit the ground running in the League Cup.\nAugust targets: Bringing Anthony Stokes, another quality striker, back to the club will be the final piece of the jigsaw for Lennon.\nIn: Vykintas Slivka, midfielder (Juventus, undisclosed); Efe Ambrose, defender (Celtic); Ofir Marciano, goalkeeper (Ashdod, undisclosed); Danny Swanson, midfielder (St Johnstone); Deivydas Matulevicius, forward (Royal Mouscron); Steven Whittaker, defender (Norwich City); Anthony Stokes, forward (Blackburn Rovers); Simon Murray, forward (Dundee United).\nOut: Jason Cummings, forward (Nottingham Forest, undisclosed); James Keatings, forward (Dundee United); Fraser Fyvie, midfielder (Dundee United); Chris Humphrey, midfielder (Bury); Jordon Forster, defender (Cheltenham Town); Alex Harris, midfielder (Falkirk); Danny Handling, forward (Dumbarton); Scott Gallacher, goalkeeper (Dumbarton); Aaron Dunsmore, defender (Elgin City); Grant Holt, forward; Brian McLean, defender; Jamie Insall, forward. Loan: Sam Stanton, midfielder (Dundee United); Callum Donaldson, defender (Berwick Rangers); Kevin Waugh, defender (Berwick Rangers); Lewis Allan, forward (Edinburgh City); Sean Mackie, defender (Edinburgh City).\nHead coach: Neil Lennon (June 2016)\nLast season: 1st, Championship\nClive's prediction: 4th. Even Rangers found the transition from Championship title winners to top-six contenders difficult last season, but Hibs have already shown they can compete with the best in cup ties last term and have added some players of undoubted quality.\nPreston's report card: Kilmarnock now have a proper manager in place with Lee McCulloch and he has recruited some good experience in Kirk Broadfoot and fellow defender Gordon Greer, who will be an excellent signing if he can play enough at the age of 36 on a 3G pitch that saps your legs.\nKey signing: It was a surprise that Motherwell let Dom Thomas go. The winger maybe got the jolt he needed by being sent out on loan to Queen of the South and has been on fire at the start of the season.\nAugust targets: Killie need someone to play up front along with Kris Boyd and play in behind him. They had Conor Sammon last season on loan and might hope they can get him again from Hearts. I expect they will also hope young defender Kristoffer Ajer returns on loan from Celtic.\nIn: Chris Burke, midfielder (Ross County); Gordon Greer, defender (Blackburn Rovers); Kirk Broadfoot, defender (Rotherham United); Lee Erwin, forward (Leeds United); Cammy Bell, goalkeeper (Dundee United); Alex Samizadeh, forward (Bolton Wanderers); Dom Thomas, midfielder (Motherwell); Stephen O'Donnell, defender (Luton Town); Calum Waters, defender (Alloa Athletic); Daniel Higgins, defender (Dundee); Alan Power, midfielder (Lincoln City).\nOut: Aaron Splaine, midfielder (Dunfermline Athletic); Lewis Morrison, forward (St Mirren); Dapo Kayode, defender; Jack Whittaker, midfielder (Cowdenbeath); Jamie Cobain, defender. Loan ended: Kristoffer Ajer, midfielder (Celtic); Conor Sammon, forward (Hearts); Josh Umerah, forward (Charlton Athletic).\nManager: Lee McCulloch (appointed January 2016)\nLast season: 8th\nClive's prediction: 6th. Lee McCulloch has added some old heads to his squad that can only suggest a higher league position than last season.\nPreston's report card: Motherwell have lost the leadership of Keith Lasley in midfield as he has turned to coaching and will hope that their summer additions have also plugged a weakness in central defence after taking a couple of hammerings last season. But Stephen Robinson has signed some decent players and they have had a good League Cup campaign.\nKey signing: Chris Cadden can provide from midfield and Louis Moult can score, so the most important thing for Motherwell this summer is to hold on to both. Aberdeen made an attempt to buy Moult and it is imperative that Motherwell keep him if they are to have a reasonable season.\nAugust targets: With the departure of Scott McDonald, I imagine they will be looking for another striker to play alongside Moult.\nIn: Cedric Kipre, defender (Leicester City); Ellis Plummer, defender (Manchester City); Alex Fisher, forward (Inverness Caledonian Thistle); Russell Griffiths, goalkeeper (Everton); Craig Tanner, midfielder (Reading); Gael Bigirimana, midfielder (Coventry City); Andy Rose, midfielder (Coventry City); Charles Dunne, defender (Oldham Athletic); Trevor Carson, goalkeeper (Hartlepool United); George Newell, forward (Bolton Wanderers); Dylan King, defender (Oldham Athletic); Liam Brown, midfielder (Queen's Park).\nOut: Dom Thomas, midfielder (Kilmarnock); Scott McDonald, forward (Dundee United); Craig Samson, goalkeeper (St Mirren); Lionel Ainsworth, midfielder (Plymouth Argyle); Joe Chalmers, defender (Inverness Caledonian Thistle); Keith Lasley, midfielder (retired); Craig Clay, midfielder (Leyton Orient); Dylan Mackin, forward (Livingston); Craig Moore, forward (Ayr United); David Ferguson, midfielder (Ayr United); James McFadden, forward; Stephen Pearson, midfielder; Lee Lucas, midfielder; Tom Fry, midfielder; Jordan Pettigrew, goalkeeper. Loan ended: Zak Jules, defender (Reading); Oliver Pain, goalkeeper (Sunderland).\nManager: Stephen Robinson (appointed March 2017)\nLast season: 9th\nClive's prediction: 10th. Northern Irishman Stephen Robinson has built a little English enclave at Fir Park as he has recruited from leagues down south he knows best. League Cup results suggest his side have improved, but they might just find that others have improved more.\nPreston's report card: Thistle have been relatively quiet in the transfer market, but Alan Archibald still has the nucleus of a very good squad. He has brought in Jordan Turnbull, who is a very good footballer, from Coventry City, while Blair Spittal has started the season well having lost his way in a struggling Dundee United side.\nKey signing: Liam Lindsay has gone to Barnsley, but he is a different kind of player to Turnbull. Lindsay is a strong centre-half, but Turnbull is a lovely passer of the ball.\nAugust targets: Thistle have lost Mustapha Dumbuya for several months through injury, so another right-back was Archibald's priority and he has brought in Milan Nitriansky, who last played with Bohemians 1905 in the Czech top flight.\nIn: Milan Nitriansky, defender (Bohemians 1905); Niall Keown, defender (Reading, undisclosed); Blair Spittal, midfielder (Dundee United); Jamie Sneddon, goalkeeper (Cowdenbeath). Loan: Jordan Turnbull, defender (Coventry City).\nOut: Liam Lindsay, defender (Barnsley, undisclosed); Mark Ridgers, goalkeeper (Inverness Caledonian Thistle); Ade Azeez, forward (Cambridge United); David Amoo, midfielder (Cambridge United); David Wilson, midfielder (Dumbarton); Michael McMullin, defender (Albion Rovers); Dominic Docherty, midfielder (Queen's Park); Matthew McInally, defender (Cowdenbeath); Sean Welsh, midfielder; Conor Cullen, goalkeeper; Jamie Hall, midfielder; Struan Herd, goalkeeper. Loan ended: Jason Banton, midfielder (Crawley Town).\nManager: Alan Archibald (appointed January 2013)\nLast season: 6th\nClive's prediction: 11th. Archibald's Thistle defied predictions last season with a top-six finish, but the margins between sixth and bottom six were so fine that the Maryhill mob might find they are in a struggle at the bottom again due to their inferior playing budget.\nPreston's report card: Pedro Caixinha has had a massive turnover of players and Ryan Jack is a good signing. Although Rangers have paid money for them, I am not sure what some of the foreign players will bring, especially when it comes to a cold November night in Dingwall.\nKey signing: Bruno Alves should be a positive influence because of his class and standing in the game, although the Portugal centre-half is 35 years old now.\nAugust targets: Rangers have shown interest in Aberdeen's Kenny McLean and Hearts' Jamie Walker and might pursue those. Meanwhile, Kenny Miller is like old father time and just keeps going, but Rangers need a striker capable of taking over from him as they can't keep relying on a 37-year-old if new signings Alfredo Morelos and Eduardo Herrera can't displace him.\nIn: Bruno Alves, defender (Cagliari, undisclosed); Graham Dorrans, midfielder (Norwich City, undisclosed); Alfredo Morelos, forward (HJK Helsinki, undisclosed); Ryan Jack, midfielder (Aberdeen); Fabio Cardoso, defender (Vitoria Setubal, undisclosed); Daniel Candeias, midfielder (Benfica, undisclosed); Carlos Pena, midfielder (Guadalajara, undisclosed); Eduardo Herrera, forward (Pumas, undisclosed). Loan: Dalcio, midfielder (Benfica).\nOut: Barrie McKay, midfielder (Nottingham Forest, \u00a3500,000); Joe Garner, forward (Ipswich Town, undisclosed); Rob Kiernan, defender (Southend United, undisclosed); Matt Crooks, midfielder (Northampton Town, undisclosed); Billy Gilmour, midfielder (Chelsea, undisclosed); Philippe Senderos, defender; Clint Hill, defender; Max Ashmore, midfielder; Jordan Gibson, forward; Amin Bouzaig, forward; Sam Jamieson, forward; Josh Jeffries, midfielder. Loan ended: Emerson Hyndman, midfielder (Bournemouth); Jon Toral, midfielder (Arsenal). Loan: Andy Halliday, midfielder (Gabala), Michael O'Halloran, midfielder (St Johnstone); Robby McCrorie, goalkeeper (Berwick Rangers); Kyle Bradley, defender (Clyde).\nManager: Pedro Caixinha (appointed March 2017)\nLast season: 3rd\nClive's prediction: 2nd. With the amount of money Pedro Caixinha has been allowed to spend this summer, the Portuguese coach will find his position untenable unless Rangers finish second and narrow the gap between themselves and prospective champions Celtic. But they will face a tough fight to even wrest the runners-up spot from Aberdeen.\nPreston's report card: Ross County had a decent end to last season but have now lost the league's top scorer after Liam Boyce was sold to Burton Albion. We know Dingwall's not the end of the earth, but people down south seem to think it is and County often have to pay more to persuade players to go there, but they have managed to sign Billy Mckay as a replacement.\nKey signing: County will hope that Mckay can rediscover the form he showed in his first spell with Inverness after less productive times at Wigan, Dundee United and back at Caley Thistle.\nAugust targets: Mckay is a different type of striker to fellow Northern Ireland international Boyce and is more of a runner, so County might also look to bring in someone with more physical presence in central midfield to compensate.\nIn: Billy Mckay, forward (Wigan Athletic, undisclosed); Thomas Mikkelsen, forward (Odense); Sean Kelly, defender (AFC Wimbledon); Jim O'Brien, midfielder (Shrewsbury Town, loan to permanent); Tom Grivosti, defender (Bolton Wanderers). Loan: Jamie Lindsay, midfielder (Celtic).\nOut: Liam Boyce, forward (Burton Albion, undisclosed); Chris Burke, midfielder (Kilmarnock); Ian McShane, midfielder (St Mirren); Chris McLaughlin, defender (Dumbarton); David Brownlie, defender (Airdrieonians); Paul Quinn, defender; Jay McEveley, defender; Jonathan Franks, forward; Oscar Gobern, midfielder; Matt Hall, defender. Loan ended: Milan Lalkovic, midfielder (Portsmouth). Loan: Mark Foden, goalkeeper (Stirling Albion).\nManager: Jim McIntyre (appointed September 2014)\nLast season: 7th\nClive's prediction: 8th. Without chief marksman Liam Boyce, who was the Premiership's top scorer last season with 23 goals, County will find it more difficult to avoid the battle against relegation.\nPreston's report card: Tommy Wright will hope to again keep St Johnstone in the top six with a minimum of squad changes. Saints will miss Danny Swanson for his goals and ability on the ball, but they will hope that new signing Stefan Scougall can provide that from midfield.\nKey signing: Bringing Michael O'Halloran back from Rangers is a good piece of business considering three or four other clubs were interested and it would be a surprise if he was not back scoring goals now that he is under Wright's wing again.\nAugust targets: Steven Anderson is getting on in age and I would imagine Saints would be looking to bring in another centre-half as cover, or someone who can fill in across the back.\nIn: Stefan Scougall, midfielder (Sheffield United); Callum Hendry, forward (Blackburn Rovers); Kyle McClean, midfielder (Nottingham Forest); Scott Tanser, defender (Port Vale). Loan: Michael O'Halloran, midfielder (Rangers).\nOut: Danny Swanson, midfielder (Hibernian); Tam Scobbie, defender (Dundee United); Connor McLaren, forward (Montrose); George Hunter, forward; Eoghan McCawl, midfielder. Loan: Greg Hurst, forward (East Fife).\nManager: Tommy Wright (appointed June 2013)\nLast season: 4th\nClive's prediction: 5th. St Johnstone keep punching above their weight, but yet another season finishing fourth might just be beyond them thanks to the return of Hibs.",
