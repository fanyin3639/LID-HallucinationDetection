Information was passed to charities after he filled in a survey but omitted to tick a box stating that he did not want his personal details shared.\nIt is the latest in a series of cases where charities have allegedly contacted vulnerable people.\nRichard Taylor, chief executive of the Institute of Fundraising, which organised the letter to the Sunday Times, said: \"I don't know any fundraisers who wouldn't be shocked if they thought they've created anxiety and distress to members of the public.\n\"Where that's happened I want to apologise for that and say sorry, we have fallen below the expectations of the public.\"\nHe added: \"Data selling shouldn't be buried in the small print and I expect that to be dealt with so you ban the size of text where it's so small it can be lost.\"\nTim Hunter, director of fundraising for Oxfam - which does not pass on donors' details - said the public outcry over aggressive fundraising practices had forced charities to act. People's generosity \"needs to be backed up by trust,\" he added.\nOn Tuesday charity bosses will face questions from MPs over the use of call centres in fundraising.\nMeanwhile Sir Stuart Etherington, chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, is leading a review into the self-regulation of charity fundraising.\nSummary:\n",
