    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nWoods, 25, was leading in Spain but crashed on his third and final run as American McRae Williams won gold.\n\"I'm proud of my runs but I cannot fake it's been wonderful,\" he said.\n\"It's been nothing short of pathetic from the organisation to the course. I'm really happy to walk away no more injured than I already am.\"\nTalking to BBC Sport's Nick Hope in Sierra Nevada, Sheffield's Woods added: \"I'm really proud to put runs down like that and only really come a cropper because of the stupid course that wasn't built right.\n\"I don't want to be seen as the bad guy, or the one that's always kicking up a fuss, it's just that I'm so passionate about my sport and also the safety of all the skiers and there were things that just weren't right this week.\n\"We always knew that in Sierra Nevada in mid-March there would be no snow.\n\"A lot of my friends got hurt fighting for what is ultimately nothing really. We're skiers and we love to do this but none of us got into it for breaking ourselves for the good of someone else.\n\"It's a free sport, an action sport. None of us ever asked to be in the Olympics. We look great on TV and it's a money maker for the guys in charge.\n\"It's a young sport and usually it comes out really well but there's a lot of input we can give, examples from events like this, and one day it is going to be fantastic from all aspects.\n\"It is my passion and that's why I can't fake a smile right now. I really want to do my bit to leave this sport on a real high, not my performance but the way the sport is.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nJoseph Thomas Fitzgerald, co-ordinator for freestyle skiing for the International Ski Federation, accepted the weather had \"been really tough to work with\" and they needed \"more contingency planning\" but they \"adjusted all kinds of regulations and schedules to help athletes\".\nHe added: \"We stopped the qualification so obviously we are listening to views and tried to do it the next day.\n\"We created a semi-finals to help more athletes reach the finals, so we tried every trick in the book in order to make the competition work.\"\nWoods led after round two with 90.40 points but Williams beat that with 93.80 on run three.\nGus Kenworthy - who was born in Chelmsford but competes for the USA - scored 91.80 to finish second as Woods crashed and was unable to better his second run.\nIn the women's event, Atkin scored 83.20 to claim third behind France's Tess Ledeux (85.60) and Sweden's Emma Dahlstrom (83.80).\nThe 18-year-old, who was born in the USA, said: \"To put it down on my final run was amazing.
