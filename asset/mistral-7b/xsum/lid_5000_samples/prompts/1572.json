    "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nImages of 16-year-old Sam Kanizay's injuries in Melbourne, Australia, have seized attention around the world.\nHis father, Jarrod Kanizay, said his son had arrived home with what \"looked like a war injury\" after soaking his legs in Melbourne's Brighton Beach following a football game.\nExperts believe the multiple pin-prick injuries were most likely tiny bite marks.\nMr Kanizay said doctors could not say for certain, so he returned to the bayside beach and used pieces of steak to capture \"thousands of these little mite-type bugs\".\n\"I collected these strange creatures from the same spot last night by trapping them in a net and standing in the water myself,\" he told the BBC.\nMr Kanizay sent samples to marine biologists at Museums Victoria, who identified them as a species of crustacean called the amphipod, or sea flea, mostly likely from the lysianassidae family.\nHowever another expert, Dr Murray Thomson from the University of Sydney, said another type of crustacean - an isopod called cirolana harfordi - may have bitten the teenager.\nWARNING: This article contains a close up image of the injury.\nAmphipods feed largely on dead marine animals such as fish and crabs, and are themselves prey for larger marine animals.\n\"If we did not have them, we would have a sea full of dead fish and dead birds,\" Dr Genefor Walker-Smith, the marine biologist who viewed Mr Kanizay's sample, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.\nDr Thomson said isopods also eat mainly dead fish and marine worms, as well as living fish.\nBoth amphipods and isopods are mainly active at night.\nIt was most likely a combination of factors, including time of day and cold water numbing Sam's skin, according to experts.\nThe teenager has described standing for about 30 minutes before feeling pins and needles around his ankles, then shaking off what he initially took to be sand.\nAssociate Prof Richard Reina, from Monash University, described the case as very unusual.\n\"It's only when you get the potential for hundreds or thousands of them to start biting you, for a long period, that you get the type of injury that Sam had,\" he told the BBC.\n\"Unless you're effectively numb, [usually] you're going to notice and get out of the water before that happens.\"\nDr Walker-Smith said it is possible that Sam may have interrupted the animals feeding on something else.\nThe teenager and his family have said it took time for the blood to clot, and that on Monday it was \"still seeping\".\nAssoc Prof Reina said this was probably due to tissue damage caused by having so many small bites.\nHe likened Sam's ordeal to being bitten by mosquitoes or leeches.\n\"If you imagine that you had your arms exposed somewhere and you had hundreds of mosquitoes biting your arm, without you realising it for some reason, then they could probably cause some fairly significant wounds as well,\" he said.\nNot according to experts, who say small crustaceans are found in abundance - making this incident an \"unfortunate coincidence\".\nDr Walker-Smith said it was much more likely for someone to suffer bites on a smaller scale and have only minor irritation.\nSummary:\n",
