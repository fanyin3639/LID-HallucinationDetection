        "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nThe collection comprises works by around 60 of the most prominent artists of the Pre-Raphaelite period, with many of the pictures portraying their wives and girlfriends.\nHere we explore the story behind a selection of the pictures on show.\nPaintings by Frederic George Stephens are rare as he was a practising artist for only a short time - before pursuing life as an art critic. Stephens also claimed to have destroyed nearly all his works.\nThis painting, however, remains and one can assume that is due to the sitter having some significance to the artist. It is believed that the portrait is of Stephens' wife Clare, who was apparently completely illiterate when Stephens met her. He taught her how to read and write and how to behave properly in society.\nIt was perhaps for this reason that the artist kept the early history of his relationship with his wife a closely guarded secret and only introduced Clare to his family and friends after their marriage in 1866.\nSoon after Emma Hill began to model for the artist Madox Brown in 1848, the two became romantically involved and started having an affair. Their relationship progressed rapidly, and in September the couple spent a week together near Ramsgate, a trip later described by their grandson as their honeymoon.\nThis tender, delicately executed portrait was sketched on 5 April 1853, the day of Brown and Emma's wedding. They were married at St. Dunstanin-the-West, London, with Brown's good friends Thomas Seddon and Dante Gabriel Rossetti as the witnesses.\nIn Brown's depiction, he captures Emma's easy-going and gentle nature, which did much to balance his cantankerous disposition and moodiness. However, the path of love never did run smoothly for the couple. During the winter of 1851-52, Madox Brown was struck with severe depression, possibly even a nervous breakdown - as a result of overwhelming financial issues. But the two were able to overcome this together and remained happily married until Emma died in October 1890, Madox dying three years later in Primrose Hill.\nAt the tender age of 16 the actress Ellen Terry wed the artist George Frederic Watts, a man thirty-years her senior. Watts felt the stage was no place for a young woman and by marrying Ellen, he could lead her away from the theatre, giving her an education and social acceptance.\nOnly a year into their marriage the couple separated - leading to a difficult divorce with many stipulations placed on Ellen; if she was to return to acting her allowance would be reduced dramatically. However, this did not hold the young actress back as she eventually became the leading English actress of her time.\nThis portrait of Ellen is extremely rare as Watts destroyed many of the portraits and studies he had produced of her after the breakdown of their marriage.\nAfter only a two-month engagement, Holman Hunt and Fanny Waugh (left) married on 28 December 1865. The artist professed his excitement in a letter to his friend, the sculptor Thomas Woolner, writing, \"my engagement to Fanny Waugh may be spoken of publicly. It makes me more truly happy than I have been for many years\".\nFanny often joined Hunt on his travels, claiming she had no intention of staying in England while her husband went off without her. It was, however, during one of their many trips that tragedy struck. While in Florence, Fanny died during childbirth.\nThe heartbroken Hunt wrote to his friend, art critic Frederick George Stephens: \"I am alone now - more tragically solitary than ever I knew a man in this world could be\u2026 It is my one comfort that she loved me beyond all measure, that she valued this affection for me so highly that I was her first thought in the hope that her life might be spared to her.\"\nFollowing Fanny's death, Hunt sought companionship in those closest to her, leading to his relationship with her younger sister Edith (right). The couple married in 1875 in Switzerland - marriage to the sibling of a deceased spouse was unlawful under British law.\nThis caused outrage amongst Edith's family and a permanent rift with friends of the couple.\nThe portraits of the sisters highlight their distinct likeness, especially as the image of Edith, created some ten years later, was executed in the same chalk technique.\nThe lives of the Pre-Raphaelites were never without scandal, the story of the Ruskins and Millais being no exception. Ruskin met Millais after sending two letters to the artist, one asking him to paint his portrait, the other proposing marriage to his daughter Effie.\nThe marriage, however, was far from a happy one, with Effie later claiming that Ruskin was a \"monstrous tyrant\".

But the two were able to overcome this together and remained happily married until Emma died in October 1890, Madox dying three years later in Primrose Hill.\nAt the tender age of 16 the actress Ellen Terry wed the artist George Frederic Watts, a man thirty-years her senior. Watts felt the stage was no place for a young woman and by marrying Ellen, he could lead her away from the theatre, giving her an education and social acceptance.\nOnly a year into their marriage the couple separated - leading to a difficult divorce with many stipulations placed on Ellen; if she was to return to acting her allowance would be reduced dramatically. However, this did not hold the young actress back as she eventually became the leading English actress of her time.\nThis portrait of Ellen is extremely rare as Watts destroyed many of the portraits and studies he had produced of her after the breakdown of their marriage.\nAfter only a two-month engagement, Holman Hunt and Fanny Waugh (left) married on 28 December 1865. The artist professed his excitement in a letter to his friend, the sculptor Thomas Woolner, writing, \"my engagement to Fanny Waugh may be spoken of publicly. It makes me more truly happy than I have been for many years\".\nFanny often joined Hunt on his travels, claiming she had no intention of staying in England while her husband went off without her. It was, however, during one of their many trips that tragedy struck. While in Florence, Fanny died during childbirth.\nThe heartbroken Hunt wrote to his friend, art critic Frederick George Stephens: \"I am alone now - more tragically solitary than ever I knew a man in this world could be\u2026 It is my one comfort that she loved me beyond all measure, that she valued this affection for me so highly that I was her first thought in the hope that her life might be spared to her.\"\nFollowing Fanny's death, Hunt sought companionship in those closest to her, leading to his relationship with her younger sister Edith (right). The couple married in 1875 in Switzerland - marriage to the sibling of a deceased spouse was unlawful under British law.\nThis caused outrage amongst Edith's family and a permanent rift with friends of the couple.\nThe portraits of the sisters highlight their distinct likeness, especially as the image of Edith, created some ten years later, was executed in the same chalk technique.\nThe lives of the Pre-Raphaelites were never without scandal, the story of the Ruskins and Millais being no exception. Ruskin met Millais after sending two letters to the artist, requesting a portrait of his wife Effie. Millais agreed and the two met in London in 1848.\nThe couple were married in 1849, but Effie had never been in love with Millais and the marriage was a disaster. Effie was unfa",
        "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nThe collection comprises works by around 60 of the most prominent artists of the Pre-Raphaelite period, with many of the pictures portraying their wives and girlfriends.\nHere we explore the story behind a selection of the pictures on show.\nPaintings by Frederic George Stephens are rare as he was a practising artist for only a short time - before pursuing life as an art critic. Stephens also claimed to have destroyed nearly all his works.\nThis painting, however, remains and one can assume that is due to the sitter having some significance to the artist. It is believed that the portrait is of Stephens' wife Clare, who was apparently completely illiterate when Stephens met her. He taught her how to read and write and how to behave properly in society.\nIt was perhaps for this reason that the artist kept the early history of his relationship with his wife a closely guarded secret and only introduced Clare to his family and friends after their marriage in 1866.\nSoon after Emma Hill began to model for the artist Madox Brown in 1848, the two became romantically involved and started having an affair. Their relationship progressed rapidly, and in September the couple spent a week together near Ramsgate, a trip later described by their grandson as their honeymoon.\nThis tender, delicately executed portrait was sketched on 5 April 1853, the day of Brown and Emma's wedding. They were married at St. Dunstanin-the-West, London, with Brown's good friends Thomas Seddon and Dante Gabriel Rossetti as the witnesses.\nIn Brown's depiction, he captures Emma's easy-going and gentle nature, which did much to balance his cantankerous disposition and moodiness.
