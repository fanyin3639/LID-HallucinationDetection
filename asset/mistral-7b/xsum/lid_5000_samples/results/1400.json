        "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nIn the searing heat, Keegan and others waited, for hours. For so many people, this was a worthwhile way to show solidarity, support and strength, at a time of loss.\nWhile no-one I spoke to in the queue was personally affected by this tragedy, people still felt compelled to give up their time in this way.\nAs the day progressed, the offers of help ballooned as volunteers turned up to help those who were waiting in the queue. Local restaurants arrived with food donations, church groups brought water, local companies donated portable fans.\nThis show of togetherness was demonstrated in the range of people who showed up - there was young and old, gay and straight. And people from all faiths.\n\"Orlando Strong\" is how many describe the spirit here. And this show of help and love has demonstrated that.\n\"All the people lining up to donate says a lot about the diversity we have here in Orlando... and about the way that the community will come together.\n\"When things like this happen, communities need to pull together.\n\"A lot of people in this line do not personally know anyone affected, but we know it affects our community and we want people to know that we stand strong.\"\nRead about the victims here\n\"After I heard about what happened last night I was pretty devastated about it. I wanted to give my support.\n\"I've been to the nightclub before but I wasn't there last night... Every time I've been there it's been pretty fun. It's a very friendly atmosphere. Everybody's having a good time, getting to know each other. There's never been any trouble there before so I was pretty surprised when I woke up this morning and heard about what happened.\n\"Since I've been here, I've felt very welcome. Orlando seems very gay-friendly.\n\"Last night a big attack on a specific group of people at a specific place - just to get so many people like that - was a big surprise to me.\"\nLGBT community under siege\n\"We are here to help as much as we can... to share the hurt that everybody else has felt, we also feel the same. We condemn this act wholeheartedly.\n\"Hopefully the community will understand these [terrorist attacks] are acts of just a few people - they don't reflect what everybody else [in the Muslim community] feels... This is not an act that we encourage at all, or that we accept or condone.\n\"I believe we all want to live in a world that promotes peace, love, unity and harmony.\"\nObama: US united in grief and resolve\n\"I had to do something.
