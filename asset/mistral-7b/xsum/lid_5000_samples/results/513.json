They were taken off the ride by firefighters using a hydraulic platform.\nMiss Balch later underwent surgery for \"significant\" leg injuries and remains in hospital.\nMiss Balch said: \"It felt like slow motion. We banged into the car in front. I felt the bars go into my knees; we moved backwards and the car went into us again.\n\"I passed out. I was awoken by Dan shouting my name.

We banged into the car in front. I felt the bars go into my knees; we moved backwards and the car went into us again.\n\"I passed out. I was awoken by Dan shouting my name.
