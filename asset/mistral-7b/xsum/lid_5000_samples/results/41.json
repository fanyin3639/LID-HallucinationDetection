When it comes to equal pay for similar work, Sweden is close to the OECD average and drops to 35th place on the World Economic Forum's gender equality ranking.\nIt isn't difficult to find Swedes who are willing to talk about the discrepancies.\n\"There's still a lot of fathers who don't take their parental leave so it's not perfect yet,\" says Martin Hector, 32, as he takes his baby son for a stroll in Ralambshovs park in central Stockholm.\n\"Over the summer, for three months or something like that, feels the most common.\"\nHe's planning to take a total of nine months off work.\nCamilla Dath, a lawyer who is also braving unusually chilly May temperatures of 2C with her seven-month-old, is taking 11 months' leave and says her husband will take a similar period off work.\nBut other parents might not have the same opportunities, she argues, if one partner earns substantially more than the other or because they work in organisations with more old-fashioned  cultures.\n\"I have friends working in big law firms and they have a harder time to take parental leave,\" she says.\nWhen it comes to the number of women in management, the biggest discrepancies are still in  the traditionally \"male\" industries of manufacturing and technology.\nHowever, Allbright's research suggests that financial services and property companies have made \"significant\" improvements in recent years.\nRental accommodation firm Heba, for example, recently climbed 100 places in Allbright's rankings after replacing several of its top male executives, resulting in a female majority in management.\nHowever its chief executive, Lennart Karlsson, is candid enough to admit that reaching gender equality was not his original goal.\n\"I thought competence was the main thing - competence and attitude - not sex, but I've changed my mind.
