A superb 135 break gave him an 18-15 victory over the Welshman, but what followed was pure emotion.\nAs the Northern Irishman was handed the trophy and winners' cheque, the tears flowed, but the rest of the nation soon followed as Higgins mouthed \"my baby, my baby\" with 18-month old blonde-haired daughter Lauren and wife Lynn delivering a loving embrace in the arena.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nOnly one previous televised 147 break had been made in the sport's history before Thorburn - helped by a fluked opening red - pocketed all the balls up until the pink. \"Good luck, mate,\" whispered Jack Karnehm in the BBC commentary box, before Thorburn sunk the final black. He dropped to his knees and held the cue aloft in the air as the crowd erupted.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nWidely regarded as the best match in the championship's history, the 1985 final attracted 18.5 million viewers. Overwhelming favourite Steve Davis - aiming to become the first player in the modern game to win three consecutive world titles - looked to be on his way to a comfortable win after taking an 8-0 lead, before Taylor began an astonishing comeback.\nIn the deciding 35th frame, which lasted 68 minutes, Northern Irishman Taylor potted brown, blue and pink, taking the final frame to the final black, which Davis overcut from a blind pot. Taylor knocked it in and produced his famous, finger-wagging, cue waving celebration.\nThe following year Davis reached another final, coming up against Yorkshireman Joe Johnson, who had never won a tournament in seven years as a professional. A 150-1 outsider at the start of the tournament, Johnson's nerveless showing allowed him to complete a comfortable 18-12 victory - one of the sport's most unexpected triumphs.\nScot Stephen Hendry went into the final with a fractured left arm, which gave Jimmy White hope, having lost in the previous four finals and five times in total.
