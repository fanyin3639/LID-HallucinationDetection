What keeps me awake is the noise of an angry mob and the images of the bloodied and burned body of a woman, beaten to death.\nThe frenzied attack on Farkhunda happened thousands of miles away in my hometown of Kabul, but the violent scenes have followed me here all the way to London.\nPerhaps I feel guilty for being a man. After all, men are the authors of all wars. Or for being an Afghan man. Men in my country inflict similar misery upon women time and again in one corner of the country or another.\nI left Kabul weeks before Farkhunda set foot in the Shah-Du-Shamshaira (The King of Two Swords) shrine.\nIt is a beautiful building on the banks of the Kabul river in the centre of the city. The main bazaar and the presidential palace are both within walking distance.\nPeople often come here to make a wish or seek resolution to a problem by tying a ribbon on a tomb in the grounds.\nA few weeks before I left Kabul I went to the shrine to tie a ribbon on behalf of a friend in California.  She had asked me to take a picture and send it to her.\nAs I climbed the steps, I noticed a large group of women gathered nearby. It was a Wednesday, a traditional day for female worshippers to visit shrines across the country.\nI made my way inside and fixed a piece of shiny green polyester to one of the four cloth covered poles at the tomb, adding to the dozens already there, all in different colours, attached to the top of the tomb and the interior walls.\n\"What did you wish for?\" a middle-aged woman asked, straining to make herself heard above the noise of the crowd. I responded, \"A wish is a secret, Khala (auntie).\"\nAs I was leaving, I noticed at least two old men with long beards and white turbans, sitting very close to the women and scribbling something on small pieces of paper.\nThat too is a common sight. Women come to ask such men for charms or amulets to help deal with a family problem - to bring good health to their husbands, to keep their sons safe in the army, or to find good husbands for their daughters.\nIt is a source of income for such poorly educated mullahs - however dubious the service.\nIn Afghanistan both on television and on social media there is growing criticism of this practice, with people saying that it is not only an abuse of Islam, but also fraud.\nFarkhunda, the woman who was killed in Kabul last week, was one of these critics. A theology graduate, she went one step further than speaking out in the media.
