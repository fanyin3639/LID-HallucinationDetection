Wood established her particular brand of comedy in front of millions of viewers, who came to love her comic songs and piano playing.\nWood, who first met Julie Walters in the early 1970s, met the actress again in 1978 when they appeared together in the same theatre revue, In At The Death.\nIts success led to the commission of Wood's first play, Talent, which won her a most promising new writer award and led to Peter Eckersly, the head of drama at Granada Television, inviting her to create a version for TV, starring Walters.\nThree more plays followed, which again inspired Eckersley to approach Wood to create and star in a comedy sketch show.\nInitially reluctant, Wood came round when her requirement that Walters share equal billing with her in the show was met. The resultant show was Wood and Walters which ran for seven episodes in 1982.\nAround this time, the comedian also married the magician Geoffrey Durham - also known as the Great Soprendo - whom Wood had known since the age of 23. The couple married in March 1980 and went on to have two children before separating in 2002.\nWood once admitted she was never \"very keen\" on getting married, and for years she even refused to wear a wedding ring.\nShe once said: \"Being a wife never appealed to me and I was so embarrassed when I got married that I didn't tell anyone for two years.\"\nWood's Granada series fell apart in 1984 following the death of her champion Eckersley and she left for the BBC, wooed by the promise of more creative control.\nThis freedom led to the now-renowned Victoria Wood: As Seen on TV, for which Wood chose a cast of actors and actresses she admired including Celia Imrie, Susie Blake, Patricia Routledge and, of course, Walters.\nThe series became most famous for its soap opera spoof Acorn Antiques, featuring Walters as Mrs Overall and Imrie as the sarcastic, upper-class Miss Babs.
