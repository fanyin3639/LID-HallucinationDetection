        "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nBallot initiatives can be brought to a vote either by the elected legislature in each state or via a public petition.\nFor an issue raised in a petition to make it on the ballot, it must receive a certain number of signatures - and in most states that number is based on voter turnout in the previous election year.\nSince voter turnout in 2014 was the lowest since World War Two, it is easier this year for activists to gather the signatures needed to get their issue in front of voters.\nWith 33 state legislatures controlled by Republicans, liberal-leaning groups have turned to petitions to get issues like marijuana legalisation and increases in the minimum wage on to ballots.\nBelow are some of the more than 72 initiatives being considered by Americans this year.\nFive states (Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts and Nevada) are voting on the legal sale and use of cannabis. The \"yes\" vote is currently leading in all five states, and is widely supported by young voters from both major parties. Currently about 5% of Americans live in states where they can legally light up, but after November that figure could rise to 25%, signalling a possible cultural shift that could help bring an end to federal prohibition. In Arizona, the initiative has been opposed with the help of a $500,000 (\u00a3413,000) donation from a drug company that produces the synthetic opioid pain reliever fetanyl. Elsewhere, the pro-legalisation effort is being funded by the nascent legal marijuana industry, which already operates in four states.\nNevada will vote on ending the state energy monopoly held by NV Energy. Las Vegas casinos have led the effort to create a competitive electricity market, due largely to the sheer amount they use. The ballot measure would allow businesses and households to choose their own electricity supplier or even produce it themselves using solar panels or windmills. Clean energy groups (including Tesla) have backed the effort, while workers unions have opposed it, claiming that it will drive up electricity costs.\nFour states, which together contain more than 50 million Americans, will vote on significant new firearm restrictions. Polling shows that over 60% of voters in Maine approve of a law which would require background checks for all private gun sales, applying the same standard now required of licensed gun shops and dealers. Nevada will consider a similar universal background check law. In California, a proposition could create an outright ban on high-capacity magazines and require background checks for ammunition sales. And in Washington state, voters will decide if courts can authorise \"extreme risk protection orders\", temporarily banning individuals from owning guns - if a judge decides that they are a danger to themselves or others. Polling indicates that all four initiatives may pass, despite efforts by the National Rifle Association to prevent it. The attempt to change state laws marks a new strategy by gun-control advocates, after several attempts to pass national reforms failed.\nVoters reinstated the death penalty in California in 1978 by executing 13 inmates that year. Today there are nearly 750 people on the state's death row, but no executions have been held since 2006, when a federal judge placed them on hold due to concerns over the lethal injection process. One Californian judge famously said that \"the leading cause of death on death row is old age.\"\nIn less than two weeks, Californians will vote on 17 different ballot initiatives, including two that seek to change the state's death penalty laws. Prop 62 seeks to eliminate capital punishment and replace it with life in prison without the possibility of release.

The \"yes\" vote is currently leading in all five states, and is widely supported by young voters from both major parties. Currently about 5% of Americans live in states where they can legally light up, but after November that figure could rise to 25%, signalling a possible cultural shift that could help bring an end to federal prohibition. In Arizona, the initiative has been opposed with the help of a $500,000 (\u00a3413,000) donation from a drug company that produces the synthetic opioid pain reliever fetanyl. Elsewhere, the pro-legalisation effort is being funded by the nascent legal marijuana industry, which already operates in four states.\nNevada will vote on ending the state energy monopoly held by NV Energy. Las Vegas casinos have led the effort to create a competitive electricity market, due largely to the sheer amount they use. The ballot measure would allow businesses and households to choose their own electricity supplier or even produce it themselves using solar panels or windmills. Clean energy groups (including Tesla) have backed the effort, while workers unions have opposed it, claiming that it will drive up electricity costs.\nFour states, which together contain more than 50 million Americans, will vote on significant new firearm restrictions. Polling shows that over 60% of voters in Maine approve of a law which would require background checks for all private gun sales, applying the same standard now required of licensed gun shops and dealers. Nevada will consider a similar universal background check law. In California, a proposition could create an outright ban on high-capacity magazines and require background checks for ammunition sales. And in Washington state, voters will decide if courts can authorise \"extreme risk protection orders\", temporarily banning individuals from owning guns - if a judge decides that they are a danger to themselves or others. Polling indicates that all four initiatives may pass, despite efforts by the National Rifle Association to prevent it. The attempt to change state laws marks a new strategy by gun-control advocates, after several attempts to pass national reforms failed.\nVoters reinstated the death penalty in California in 1978 by executing 13 inmates that year. Today there are nearly 750 people on the state's death row, but no executions have been held since 2006, when a federal judge placed them on hold due to concerns over the lethal injection process. One Californian judge famously said that \"the leading cause of death on death row is old age.\"\nIn less than two weeks, Californians will vote on 17 different ballot initiatives, including two that seek to change the state's death penalty laws. Prop 62 seeks to eliminate capital punishment and replace it with life in prison without the possibility of release. Prop 66 supporters want to \"mend, not end\" the death penalty, mainly by shortening the appeal process after conviction.\nSan Francisco residents are considering a ban on homeless encampments, some of which have grown to \"tent cities\" of 30-40 tent and cardboard box shelters. Prop Q was authored by Mark Farrell, a San Francisco city supervisor who told the BBC that the camps had become \"the symbol of the city's homeless problem\" and that they are \"some of the most dangerous places you can imagine\". The measure has been popular among the newly arrived tech workers of Silicon Valley, but critics say loitering is already a crime and the initiative is only intended to \"give the appearance that we are doing something\".\nWho is backing Prop Q in San Francisco?\nCalifornian voters will decide whether condoms should be required to be worn in adult movies filmed in the state. Proposition 60 would allow any California resident to sue porn producers if they fail to use condoms, and would require actors to disclose their real names and be tested for sexually transmitted diseases. The measure has been opposed by the porn industry, which argues that it would lead to a loss of jobs and would be difficult to enforce.\nVot",
