Weeks later Mrs Watanabe, 58, doused herself in kerosene and set herself on fire.\nHer husband and three children sued Tepco for 91 million yen.\nThey claimed the evacuation was responsible for a deterioration of Mrs Watanabe's mental state because she did not know when she could return home, according to Kyodo news agency. The chicken farm where she and her husband were working also closed.\nFollowing the verdict, Tepco released a statement reiterating that it was sorry for the accident and said it would study the verdict and \"respond in a sincere way\".\n\"We pray that Hamako Watanabe has found peace,\" the company added.\nMr Watanabe said he was \"satisfied\" with the court decision.\nIt is not the first time Tepco has paid out compensation.
