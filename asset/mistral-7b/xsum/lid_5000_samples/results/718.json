For that, we are all hugely grateful to both of them.\"\nBudge said that they felt they needed someone of Levein's experience to develop a long-term strategy.\n\"Craig Levein will join the club with immediate effect and will assume total responsibility for everything to do with the playing side of the business,\" she said.\n\"He will be responsible for putting in place an end-to-end strategy for how we are going to implement a youth-driven playing policy within the club.\n\"These decisions have been driven by everything that has been said about needing a long-term strategy, built over a three-to-five-year planning horizon.\n\"For those reasons, the new board believes that we need to bring in someone with Craig's experience to guide that vision.\"\nJohn Murray will return to his former role as chief scout and will assist in running the club's academy, but Budge said that Hearts would be looking for someone to run the youth set-up.\n\"With such a strong director of football on board, we feel we have to spend our limited resources on strengthening and building the coaching side of the business, rather than having a first-team manager,\" she explained.\n\"Robbie Neilson will take over as head coach for the first team and we will bring in a strong support team to work with Robbie in terms of an assistant coach and under-20s coach.\n\"Over the next few days, a number of other changes will be announced as we start the process of rebuilding our great club.\"\nThe three experienced players were a result of Hearts' decision to concentrate on developing their young talent.\n\"We will have to say good-bye to a number of the fans' current favourites; we will do our best to secure all our excellent young players; and we will welcome a group of new players, who will help us achieve our vision,\" added Budge.\n\"A number of the decisions we make over the next few days and weeks will be driven by finance.\n\"We have to ensure we live within our means.
