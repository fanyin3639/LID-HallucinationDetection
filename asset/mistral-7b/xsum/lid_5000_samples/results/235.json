It looked like thousands of young people were going to be frozen out of higher education.\nBut what happened next was less predictable. University applications bounced back. And with this year's deadline approaching on Thursday, they're climbing back to record levels again.\nIt looks as though the massive underlying demand for higher education has snow-ploughed its way through the financial barrier of trebling fees.\nThe huge expansion in university access over the past 50 years has been a quiet but relentless revolution - and this autumn more than 500,000 places were allocated for the first time.\nThe Ucas number crunchers say that applications are slightly below what they would have been if fees had not been increased, but not by much, and the long-term upward trend has returned.\nThe other big concern in 2012 was that poorer students would be the hardest hit by the higher fees.\nBut this has not followed the expected script. It's been the reverse. Instead of deterring disadvantaged students, there are more entering university now than when fees were lower.\nGoing to university has become a symbol of aspiration and families are willing to pay the price.\nRather like house prices, young people might not want the higher fees but they seemed to have gritted their teeth and taken on the debt, making the calculation that it was still better value than not having a degree.\nOf course, there is still a cast-iron link between affluence and university entrance - the richer the family, the more likely that the child will go to university. But the rise in going to university has taken place across all social classes.\nNick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, says that for \"first-time full-time students, the system has worked out at least as well as anyone could have hoped\".\nAnd the international evidence suggests that the \"apparently unstoppable demand will continue\".\nBut does that mean it's business as usual and nothing has changed? Not really. The impact has been reverberating in unexpected ways.\nAaron Porter was the high-profile leader of the National Union of Students in the tumultuous 2010 campaign against higher tuition fees.\nLooking back he says that while applications have recovered for full-time undergraduates, there have been \"devastating\" consequences for other types of students, which have gone below the radar.\n\"Part-time students appear to be considerably more concerned about the price tag,\" said Mr Porter. \"We have seen a chilling drop of 50% in part-time students since 2010. Had we seen anything like a 50% drop for full time students, the criticism would have been deafening.\"\nMature students, who might want to upgrade their work skills, have also been much more sensitive to higher fees, says Mr Porter, who is now head of external affairs at the National Centre for Universities and Business.\nAnd the increase in fees represents a long-term threat to the pipeline of students needed for advanced, postgraduate research.\n\"So whilst on the surface, the recovery in demand for full-time undergraduate students is welcome, this is only part of the picture as they only comprise 56% of our student population. For the other 44%, the situation appears to have remained static and for many has worsened considerably,\" he says.\nThere are also big, far-reaching questions about the longer-term impact, such as opening the door to much higher, US-style fees.\nLast week the UK's first private medical school opened at the University of Buckingham, charging tuition fees of \u00a336,000 per year. The demand to study medicine is so strong that they haven't struggled to fill places.\nBut is charging over \u00a3162,000 for a medical degree going to widen the social gap?
