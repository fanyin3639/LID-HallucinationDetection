Here are six good reasons.\nIn brief, because Britain is still a very rich and powerful country that millions of people visit or move to every year; because all its various internal divisions of class, region, wealth, race make it a fun and culturally vibrant place; and, for goodness sake, because nobody has the faintest idea who is going to win.\nWhat the latest national polls say\nBuild a parliamentary majority with our game\nThe UK continues to be one of the permanent members of the UN Security Council, and a nuclear power with the fifth largest defence budget in the world. But at this election much of that is at stake.\nAt least two parties, the Scottish National Party and the Liberal Democrats, not only oppose the renewal of the UK's nuclear deterrent but may have the influence to do something about it.\nThen there's the fundamental question of Britain's relationship with Europe, with David Cameron promising an in-out referendum on membership of the European Union by the end of 2017, if he remains prime minister.\nAnd let's not forget that the rise of the Scottish National Party is sure to raise at some point the question of independence and the prospect of a somehow diminished United Kingdom.\nCould a UK without Scotland or without nuclear weapons or outside the EU still command a seat at the UN's top table, and what would Nato and the US think? These are not entirely fanciful outcomes but real possibilities.\nEU holds it breath ahead of UK vote\nEvery year since 1998, net migration to Britain - the difference between those leaving the country and coming into it - has exceeded 150,000.\nIn many of those years it has even been above a quarter of a million people.  Unsurprisingly, perhaps, immigration has been a big issue at this election just as it was in 2010.\nOne party, UKIP, is saying Britain must take back control of its borders by leaving the EU, thereby ending free movement for half a billion Europeans, and by introducing an Australian-style points system for judging who should and who shouldn't come in.\nUKIP are not going to win the election, but it's worth remembering that the Conservatives are also hoping to discourage EU nationals from coming here through changes to the benefits system, while Labour is promising to crack down on companies that use cheap foreign labour.\nAccess to the UK is likely to change in some way or another.\nStatisticians are not entirely sure, but the UK is still the fifth or sixth biggest economy in the world and the City of London rivals New York as the global centre for financial services.\nApart from the Conservatives (and even they've been rather shy) this election campaign has been pretty hostile to the wealthy and especially those who are foreign and rich.\nThe opposition Labour party, for example, is promising to raise taxes on expensive properties and to start taxing the global earnings of wealthy foreigners in London, not to mention further bank taxes and an increase in corporation tax.\nSo there is plenty to think about there for those in the boardrooms of international companies.\nThe UK's 2.6% growth rate last year made it one of the fastest growing economies in Europe.

These are not entirely fanciful outcomes but real possibilities.\nEU holds it breath ahead of UK vote\nEvery year since 1998, net migration to Britain - the difference between those leaving the country and coming into it - has exceeded 150,000.\nIn many of those years it has even been above a quarter of a million people.  Unsurprisingly, perhaps, immigration has been a big issue at this election just as it was in 2010.\nOne party, UKIP, is saying Britain must take back control of its borders by leaving the EU, thereby ending free movement for half a billion Europeans, and by introducing an Australian-style points system for judging who should and who shouldn't come in.\nUKIP are not going to win the election, but it's worth remembering that the Conservatives are also hoping to discourage EU nationals from coming here through changes to the benefits system, while Labour is promising to crack down on companies that use cheap foreign labour.\nAccess to the UK is likely to change in some way or another.\nStatisticians are not entirely sure, but the UK is still the fifth or sixth biggest economy in the world and the City of London rivals New York as the global centre for financial services.\nApart from the Conservatives (and even they've been rather shy) this election campaign has been pretty hostile to the wealthy and especially those who are foreign and rich.\nThe opposition Labour party, for example, is promising to raise taxes on expensive properties and to start taxing the global earnings of wealthy foreigners in London, not to mention further bank taxes and an increase in corporation tax.\nSo there is plenty to think about there for those in the boardrooms of international companies.\nThe UK's 2.6% growth rate last year made it one of the fastest growing economies in Europe.
