It's important to note that this study only looked at Japanese-American men, and these results may not be applicable to the wider population.\nHe said a better understanding of the links between high blood pressure and dementia could be crucial for developing new treatments or approaches to prevention.\n\"With 820,000 people affected by dementia in the UK, and that number increasing, we urgently need to find ways to prevent the diseases that cause it - that requires a massive investment in research,\" Dr Ridley added.\nSummary:\nThe medication is used to treat high blood pressure, a known risk factor for dementia.\nIn the study, which will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology's annual meeting in March, men on beta-blockers were less likely to have brain changes suggestive of dementia.",
