        "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nManchester City's hopes of making the Champions League next season is out of their hands after a draw with Arsenal, with Manchester United, who beat Norwich, two wins from a top-four spot.\nSunderland helped their survival hopes with a dramatic win over Chelsea as arch rivals Newcastle draw with relegated Aston Villa to leave their top-flight status in serious jeopardy.\nHere are my selections for this week:\nArtur Boruc's first-half fingertip save from Craig Gardner after he stopped his penalty didn't get the praise it deserved. The initial penalty save was impressive but to then stop the rebound from going in with his right hand was simply top class. For me Boruc, like many of his team-mates at Bournemouth, has slowly acclimatised to the level required to perform consistently at Premier League level.\nIt will be very interesting to see if he can continue to improve his game next season because there is no doubt that on his day the Polish international is a good as any keeper in the league. The question is does he have enough of those days?\nHe's back and looking good. Manchester United have suffered more than most from injuries this season and Antonia Valencia has been conspicuous by his absence. Nonetheless, his return to bolster the defence has come at a very important time for United and, in particular, manager Louis van Gaal.\nIt is imperative for both that United get into the Champions League and winning an FA Cup will undoubtedly strengthen the manager's position next season. It would appear, based on the last few appearances and against Norwich, that Valencia's presence in the team is critical to both scenarios.\nThis Leicester City roadshow is getting out of control. The players must have been out until the early hours after Chelsea had crushed any notion of Tottenham winning the title on Monday night. And yet they played like a team whose season had only just begun against an Everton side who looked like they were praying for it to finish.\nTheir captain and leader Wes Morgan performed like a man who has never seen a drop of alcohol pass his lips and could have played football the entire weekend without food or water. It's what superheroes are made of and right now Morgan looks like he has got a team full of them.\nI must say once Southampton equalised against Spurs, Jose Fonte and Virgil van Dijk took control at the back for the Saints. Apart from one outstanding save from Fraser Forster late in the second half, the two centre-backs looked reasonably comfortable.\nHowever, it was Van Dijk who came to the rescue on the few occasions Spurs did threaten to equalise and it is hardly surprising that Saints manager Ronald Koeman has convinced his fellow Dutchman to sign a six-year contract.\nThis lad has never looked back since the day he left Stamford Bridge for St Mary's. The Southampton defender looks every bit an international footballer and it wouldn't surprise me, as Chelsea begin rebuilding their team, if Ryan Bertrand reappears on their shopping list.\nHe looked so comfortable against Manchester City last week and at Spurs on Sunday. He seems slightly ahead in the England selection process of his Tottenham counterpart, the more combustible Danny Rose. In the European Championships you are going to need a cool head and Bertrand certainly has that.\nWhere did Swansea's 4-1 win at West Ham come from? I thought Swansea had packed sun cream and flip flops as they had their minds set on warmer climes. It couldn't have been further from the truth. They were without Ashley Williams and Gylfi Sigurdsson so it was left to Ki Sung-yueng to mastermind Swansea's revival.\nThe South Korean was involved in Swansea's first goal and scored their third. In fact, the finish was superb and put the game beyond West Ham who looked shell-shocked. Can anyone tell me what is going on at Swansea? I haven't a clue whether manager Francesco Guidolin is staying or going. What I do know is Swansea look like a team again so the sooner they settle the concerns surrounding the manager's future, the better.\nI've witnessed some amazing moments in football but nothing quite like the enormity of Leicester City's success. Within this extraordinary achievement lies a player who epitomises the very best the club and its players have to offer - his name is N'Golo Kante. As the season draws to a close, this player continues to quietly go about his business without any fuss. He never complains, hardly misses a tackle and is always in the right place at the right time.\nThe Frenchman is the perfect example of a modern day footballer.

        "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nManchester City's hopes of making the Champions League next season is out of their hands after a draw with Arsenal, with Manchester United, who beat Norwich, two wins from a top-four spot.\nSunderland helped their survival hopes with a dramatic win over Chelsea as arch rivals Newcastle draw with relegated Aston Villa to leave their top-flight status in serious jeopardy.\nHere are my selections for this week:\nArtur Boruc's first-half fingertip save from Craig Gardner after he stopped his penalty didn't get the praise it deserved. The initial penalty save was impressive but to then stop the rebound from going in with his right hand was simply top class. For me Boruc, like many of his team-mates at Bournemouth, has slowly acclimatised to the level required to perform consistently at Premier League level.\nIt will be very interesting to see if he can continue to improve his game next season because there is no doubt that on his day the Polish international is a good as any keeper in the league. The question is does he have enough of those days?\nHe's back and looking good. Manchester United have suffered more than most from injuries this season and Antonia Valencia has been conspicuous by his absence. Nonetheless, his return to bolster the defence has come at a very important time for United and, in particular, manager Louis van Gaal.\nIt is imperative for both that United get into the Champions League and winning an FA Cup will undoubtedly strengthen the manager's position next season. It would appear, based on the last few appearances and against Norwich, that Valencia's presence in the team is critical to both scenarios.\nThis Leicester City roadshow is getting out of control. The players must have been out until the early hours after Chelsea had crushed any notion of Tottenham winning the title on Monday night. And yet they played like a team whose season had only just begun against an Everton side who looked like they were praying for it to finish.\nTheir captain and leader Wes Morgan performed like a man who has never seen a drop of alcohol pass his lips and could have played football the entire weekend without food or water. It's what superheroes are made of and right now Morgan looks like he has got a team full of them.\nI must say once Southampton equalised against Spurs, Jose Fonte and Virgil van Dijk took control at the back for the Saints.
