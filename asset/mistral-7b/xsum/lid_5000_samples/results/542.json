Other British winners included Clean Bandit with Jess Glynne and Aphex Twin.\nMadonna, Katy Perry, Rihanna, Kanye West and Sir Paul McCartney were among those performing at the Los Angeles ceremony.\nBut the night belonged to Sam Smith, who has cemented his place as one of pop's biggest stars just nine months after the release of his debut album In the Lonely Hour.\nEarlier, he said: \"Before I made this record, I was doing everything to try to get my music heard... I tried to lose weight and I was making awful music. It was when I started to be myself that the music flowed.\"\nSmith's ballad Stay With Me won both song of the year and record of the year - the former recognises the songwriters, while the latter goes to the performer and producer.\nAccepting the record of the year trophy, he said: \"I want to thank the man who this record is about, who I fell in love with last year.\n\"Thank you so much for breaking my heart because you got me four Grammys.\"\nSmith also performed his the song on stage with Mary J Blige; while his other awards were best new artist and best pop vocal album.\nHe lost out on the best album award to long-serving indie troubadour Beck, who was honoured for his twelfth studio LP, Morning Phase. It also won best rock album.\n\"We made this record at my house for the most part, so I would like to thank my kids for letting me keep them awake a little bit longer,\" he said.\nPharrell's Girl won best urban contemporary album, while Happy won best music video and best pop solo performance. He performed that hit on the night with pianist Lang Lang and composer Hans Zimmer.\nDrunk In Love, Beyonce's collaboration with her husband Jay-Z, was named best R&B performance and best R&B song. Beyonce also won best surround sound album.\nThe other triple winner, Rosanne Cash, picked up the best American roots performance and song awards for A Feather's Not A Bird and best Americana album.\nAmong the British artists, Clean Bandit and Jess Glynne won best dance recording, while Aphex Twin won best dance/electronic album for Syro, his first album for 13 years.\nEd Sheeran, who had three nominations, went home empty-handed, but did join ELO's Jeff Lynne on stage to perform at the ceremony.\nOther performers on the night included Sir Paul McCartney, Kanye West and Rihanna, who teamed up to play their joint composition FourFiveSeconds.\nMadonna was joined by half-naked male dancers wearing glittering masks and horns to perform Living For Love, from her new album Rebel Heart.\nThere were also duets between Jessie J and Sir Tom Jones; Hozier and Annie Lennox; and Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett.\nThe ceremony departed from pure entertainment for a segment in which US President Barack Obama sent a recorded video message in support of a campaign against domestic violence.\nDomestic abuse survivor Brooke Axtell then delivered a poignant message about how a seemingly \"handsome, charismatic man\" had threatened to kill her.\nThe Grammys will be broadcast in the UK on Channel 4's 4Music on Monday 9 February at 21:00 GMT.\nSummary:\nSam Smith won four Grammys, including best new artist and best pop vocal album.\nPharrell Williams, Beyonce and Rosanne Cash, daughter of country legend Johnny, won three awards each.\nBeck won two, including best album. Other British winners included Clean Bandit with Jess Glynne"
