Some areas are completely destroyed.\nI am in the Thamel area and the Hotel Budget has been completely demolished with more than 50 guests inside.\nI have been helping to pull people and bodies out of the rubble, along with my friend. We pulled a child out with its grandmother earlier. They did not survive.\nI am most sad. It has been a very bad experience and a terrible and very difficult day.\nI was at home when it happened and I was so frightened. I went out on to the street and saw people on the ground and buildings collapsed.\nI went to help as much as I could. There are not enough rescue teams here. The hospitals are out of control. We need help.\nI was sitting in my house watching TV when the quake struck.\nIt was terrifying. Everything in the house started falling down. I quickly ran outside, as did all my neighbours.\nWe have been standing outside on the street since. My neighbours and I have been holding hands thanking God we are ok.\nMany houses have collapsed and people are injured. There is also water everywhere from burst pipes and it is leaking out of the houses in the area.\nMany ambulances have passed by to help the injured.\nWe may have to sleep out here tonight. The weather has improved, thankfully, but we're still too afraid to go back into our houses.\nThere are still mild tremors every 15 minutes.\nWhen we felt the earthquake, we jumped in the doorway of our hotel. We knew what to do, coming from California.\nThere were people running out of our hotel. They just fell to the ground.\nA wall about 8ft (2.5m) high came down over the road - thankfully no one was crushed.\nWithin 15 minutes there were four aftershocks. There were power lines across cars.\nWe headed down the main street where a school's entire facade had come off.\nThere were military and workers unearthing rubble and pulling out bodies.\nThere was a triage set up in the middle of the street. The non-seriously injured were wrapped up and put aside for later treatment.\nIt was the biggest earthquake I've ever been in. It felt like it went on for two minutes.\nEveryone here is just super-confused.\nInterviews by Stephen Fottrell and Sherie Ryder\nSummary:\nThe 7.8 magnitude quake caused casualties in India, Bangladesh, and Tibet as well as in Nepal.\nThose affected ranged from local people to the region's many tourists and climbers on Mount Everest.\nSome of those affected told the BBC what they had witnessed on this",
