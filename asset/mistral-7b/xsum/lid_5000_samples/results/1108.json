The Manchester Arena, meanwhile, has a capacity of 20,000.\nHowever, the Manchester Arena was only a quarter full on Saturday, suggesting that if Frampton did choose to box Quigg there, he would have the lion's share of the support, despite theoretically being the away fighter.\nQuigg holds an inferior version of the WBA title, with Cuba's Guillermo Rigondeaux the governing body's so-called 'super' champion. Rigondeaux is also the WBO title-holder but has a small following, no television deal and is the man everyone wants to avoid in the division.\nBoth men are unbeaten as professionals, with Quigg winning 28 and drawing two of his 30 paid fights and Frampton winning all 19 of his encounters.\nThe 24-year-old Joshua, who won super-heavyweight gold at London 2012, showed his patient side in the first two rounds before flooring his opponent with a signature right cross midway through the third.\nAirich, who had won 21 of his 31 previous paid fights, received a standing eight count but after Joshua landed with another thunderous right hand the German's corner threw the towel in.\nJoshua's next fight is against Russian veteran Denis Bakhtov in London on 11 October.\nAlso on the undercard, Manchester's Anthony Crolla retained his WBO inter-continental lightweight title after a technical draw with Mexico's Gamaliel Diaz.\nAn accidental clash of heads at the end of the third round left the challenger with a cut over his right eye and the doctor deemed him unfit to continue.\nHowever, it appeared Diaz had made the decision to quit before the doctor's intervention, in which case Crolla should have been awarded a stoppage.\nSummary:\nBury fighter Quigg, 25, softened the challenger up with a barrage of body shots in the first two rounds before dropping him with a huge right.\nFormer European champion Jamoye made it to his feet only for the referee to wave the fight off.\nEarlier,",
