        "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nHuman rights lawyer Patrice Spinosi said if any mayors did not comply, he would take each case to court.\nAt least three mayors have said they will keep the bans on their beaches.\nOn Friday the Council of State found the ban in one town, Villeneuve-Loubet, \"seriously and clearly illegally breached fundamental freedoms\".\nThe decision is expected to set a precedent for all the 30 or so French resorts, chiefly along the Riviera, that issued similar bans.\nVilleneuve-Loubet's mayor, Lionnel Luca, responding to the ruling, said: \"We need to decide if we want a smiley, friendly version of sharia law on our beaches or if we want the rules of the [French] Republic to be implemented.\"\nThe burkinis were not mentioned by name in the bans, with the order simply saying beachwear must be respectful of good public manners and the principle of secularism.\nAuthorities said they were concerned about the public order implications of the religious clothing, especially after attacks in Nice and Paris carried out by people influenced by Islamist extremism.\nBut while opinion polls suggested most French people backed the bans, they ignited fierce debate in France and around the world, with Muslims saying they were being unfairly targeted.\nThe controversy deepened when images circulated showing police on a beach appearing to enforce the ban, and a woman removing an item of clothing.\nThe council of state will make a final decision on the ban's legality at a later date.\nMr Spinosi represents the Human Rights League (LDH) which, along with the anti-Islamophobia association (CCIF), took Villeneuve-Loubet to the highest administrative court in the land.\n\"It is a decision that is meant to set legal precedent,\" Mr Spinosi said to reporters outside court. He said people who had been fined could claim their money back.\nCCIF head Marwan Muhammad praised the ruling but said it \"cannot take back the harm which was caused\",\nHowever, town hall authorities in Nice and Frejus, as well as in the Corsican village of Sisco, have vowed to keep the bans in place.\nThe far-right mayor of Frejus, David Rachline, told the AFP news agency that his ban was \"still valid\" and there was \"no legal procedure\" against it.\nA spokesperson for Nice town hall said it would \"continue to fine\" women wearing full Islamic coverings on the beach.\nIn the town of Sisco in Corsica, mayor Ange-Pierre Vivoni said the ban would remain \"for the safety of property and people in the town\".\nMr Sisco said it followed clashes this month between villagers and Muslim bathers.\nFrench PM Manual Valls wrote on Facebook in support of the bans, saying burkinis were \"the affirmation of political Islam in the public space\".\nAfter a militant Islamist ploughed a lorry into families on the seafront at Nice on 14 July, killing 86 people, the city's authorities said a ban was \"a necessity\".\nLocal leaders have described their actions as appropriate and proportionate.\nBut the bans are not just a response to a spate of deadly jihadist attacks on French soil. France has long-standing laws on secularism, and the Nice ban focused on \"correct dress, respectful of accepted customs and secularism, as well as rules of hygiene and of safety in public bathing areas\".\nSummary:\nHuman rights lawyer Patrice Spinosi said if any mayors did not comply, he would take each case to court.\nAt least three mayors have said they will keep the bans on their beaches.\nOn Friday the Council of State found the ban in one town, Villeneuve-Lou"
