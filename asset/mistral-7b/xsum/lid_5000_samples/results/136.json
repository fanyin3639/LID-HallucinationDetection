        "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nHer comments came as preparations were made through social media to hold a vigil in Glasgow to express solidarity with those who died.\nMeanwhile, the organisers of a Muslim peace conference being held in the west of Scotland have said a minute's silence will be held for the victims.\nThe Scottish Secular Society expressed its \"outrage\" at the Paris attacks.\nA book of condolences has opened at the French Consulate in Edinburgh for anyone who wants to show support for the people of Paris.\nMs Sturgeon said: \"I think everybody waking up this morning will be deeply shocked, and obviously our thoughts, our prayers, our solidarity, are with the people of Paris and indeed the people of France today.\n\"France has had to bear more than what any country should be expected to over the course of this year, so this is awful beyond words.\n\"On behalf of the Scottish government, and I am sure this will be the case for governments across the world, we stand ready to help in any way that we can.\"\nA page has been posted on Facebook inviting people to take part in a vigil in the centre of Glasgow at 16:00 on Saturday.\nThe organisers said it was \"To stand in solidarity with the people of Paris and show that we care. That we all care. That Glasgow cares\".\nLater on Saturday, the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community Glasgow is to hold a peace conference and dinner at Bearsden near Glasgow.\nAlthough it was organised before the events in Paris, participants will now observe a minute of silence for those killed in the attacks.\nCommunity president Muhammad Akbar Rana said: \"We organise peace conferences in Glasgow every year for more than 10 years now to talk about how we can bring about peace in the society and get to know each other better thereby breaking the barriers between Muslims and the wider community.\n\"Our main message is 'Love For All, Hatred For None' and we will be promoting the values of love, loyalty, freedom, equality, respect and peace in next week's event, which are the core values needed for any peaceful society.\"\nThe Ahmadiyya Muslim Community Glasgow said it totally condemned the \"barbaric attacks\" and added their \"deepest thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families and all the people of France\".\nThe Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland has spoken of his horror at the atrocities in Paris.\nThe Right Reverend Dr Angus Morrison said the thoughts and prayers of the Church are with the people of France.\nDr Morrison added: \"News of the latest terrorist attacks in France have shocked and appalled us all.\n\"It is impossible to comprehend the mindset that leads people to perpetrate such indiscriminate barbarity against their fellow human beings.\n\"There can be no possible justification for such wicked acts which sadly reveal humanity at its very worst.\"\nThe Scottish Secular Society said it shared the world's outrage at what happened in Paris.\nIn a statement it added: \"For 110 years France has been an inspirational country for its adherence to the principle of La\u00c3\u00afcit\u00c3\u00a9 (the French belief that government and political issues should be kept separate from religious organisations) and whilst even as this great nation is under attack we will continue to support it as the seat of secularism in Europe.\"\nSociety chairman Douglas McLellan said: \"Our hearts and minds are with the people of France today; a country and a people committed to secularism, equality and compassion.\n\"In sorrow, we hope for their safety.\"\nSummary:\n\n- The French Consulate in Edinburgh has opened a book of condolences for anyone who wants to show support for the people of Paris.\n- A page has been posted on Facebook inviting people to take part in a vigil in the centre of Glasgow at 16:00 on Saturday.\n"
