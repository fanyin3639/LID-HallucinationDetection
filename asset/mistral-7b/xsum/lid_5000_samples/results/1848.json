        "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nMK Dons started brightly, going close inside 14 minutes through Leicester loan man Harvey Barnes, whose right-footed effort from the edge of the box smacked the crossbar before Chuks Aneke's header flew inches wide.\nRobbie Neilson's side went close again two minutes after the break, as Barnes provided a cross to the edge of the Fleetwood box for the on-rushing Aneke whose low effort was well blocked by visiting keeper Alex Cairns.\nIt took Fleetwood until the second half to fashion their first meaningful chance when Cameron Brannagan's corner found Ashley Eastham but his header was cleared off the line by MK defender George Baldock.\nThe Cod Army forced the Dons into another goal-line clearance six minutes later before Bolger headed home his fifth goal of the season from George Glendon's corner just past the hour to secure all three points.\nReport supplied by the Press Association.\nMatch ends, MK Dons 0, Fleetwood Town 1.\nSecond Half ends, MK Dons 0, Fleetwood Town 1.\nHand ball by Kyle Dempsey (Fleetwood Town).\nFoul by Maecky Ngombo (MK Dons).\nCian Bolger (Fleetwood Town) wins a free kick in the attacking half.\nSubstitution, MK Dons.
