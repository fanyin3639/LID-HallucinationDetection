        "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nAn EU proposal would see Turkey offered financial aid and political concessions in return for taking back all migrants travelling to Greece.\nEU leaders have watered down the incentives and correspondents say it is unclear if a deal can be done.\nNevertheless, Mr Davutoglu said he was hopeful of finding \"common ground\".\nBut he added that he wanted to keep a \"humanitarian perspective\" on the crisis.\nEU leaders agreed on a joint position to put to Turkey after late-night talks. The plan suggests that for every Syrian refugee sent back, another Syrian would be resettled in the EU directly from refugee camps in Turkey.\nYou can follow the latest updates from Brussels through tweets by BBC reporters and we have been live on Facebook from the summit.\nAhead of Friday's talks, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Turkey had to meet international standards of protection for all migrants.\nShe said that the legal resettlement of Syrian refugees could start a few days after the first returns from Greece.\nHowever, she added that the EU needed to be ready to start returning migrants from Greece to Turkey rapidly to avoid a \"pull factor\" creating a surge of migrants before the new system takes effect.\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Europe should look at its own record on migrants before it told Turkey what to do.\nIn an uncompromising speech broadcast on television, he said: \"At a time when Turkey is hosting three million (migrants), those who are unable to find space for a handful of refugees, who in the middle of Europe keep these innocents in shameful conditions, must first to look at themselves.\"\nLithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite warned on Thursday that the plan to return people to Turkey was \"on the edge of international law\" and difficult to implement.\nBut arriving at the summit on Friday she said an agreement was possible because \"it is important and necessary for both sides\".\nMr Davutoglu has said he will not accept Turkey becoming an \"open prison\" for migrants.\nTo meet concerns over the plan's legality, the leaders discussed providing assurances that each person claiming asylum will be given a full hearing in Greece, the BBC's Damian Grammaticas reports from Brussels.\nHuman rights group Amnesty International placed a large screen outside the Brussels summit that read: \"Don't trade refugees. Stop the deal.\"\nFrench President Francois Hollande warned that \"I cannot guarantee that there will be a happy outcome\" to the search for a solution.\nSince January 2015, a million migrants and refugees have entered the EU by boat from Turkey to Greece. More than 132,000 have arrived this year alone.\nTens of thousands are now stuck in Greece as their route north has been blocked.\nCrisis explained in seven charts\nUnder initial proposals, the EU had suggested it would double financial aid to Turkey promised last year, make a fresh push on talks over Turkey's eventual membership of the EU and offer visa-free travel to Europe's Schengen states.\nHowever, those proposals have since been watered down, lowering expectation on greater financial help and talks on EU membership and linking visa-free travel to 72 conditions to which Turkey must agree.\nA number of EU countries have raised concerns about what is on offer to Turkey amid a clampdown by the Ankara government on academics and journalists.\nA note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.\nSummary:\n\nThe European Union (EU) is an economic and political union of 28 member states that are located primarily in Europe. The EU operates through a system of supranational independent institutions and intergovernmental negotiated decisions by the member states.\n\nThe EU has developed an internal single market through"
