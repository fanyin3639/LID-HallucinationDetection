That, coupled with a fantastic effort from festival goers in taking their belongings home, meant that the bulk of the litter picking work was completed after 2.5 days (in 2016, a very wet year, the equivalent period was around 10 days).\"\nSummary:\nThe Labour leader appeared on stage at last month's event to speak about employment rights among other issues.\nMost of the workers hired, from around Europe, to clean up after the festival were reportedly laid off early.\nBut organisers said the litter pickers had \"temporary\" agreements which guaranteed at least",
