It was their team that fell apart, not an individual.\nThe midfield was always going to be where the game would be won and lost. At first it was City who were on top.\nPellegrini sprang a bit of a surprise when he brought James Milner into the team, but instead of playing alongside Toure and Fernandinho, his job was to drop on to Michael Carrick and stop him from setting the rhythm of the game and dictating play for United.\nIt worked early on, when Sergio Aguero also dropped deep as well and found some brilliant positions to make things difficult for United's centre-backs.\nChris Smalling and Phil Jones both wanted to stay tight to Aguero so they were sucked out with him, leaving space for Jesus Navas and David Silva to run through inside. As a result, Navas had a great chance to score before Silva set up Aguero for his opener.\nAt that stage, United looked there for the taking but the minute something went wrong for City, Pellegrini's side crumbled, and they could not respond.\nAs soon as Louis van Gaal's side equalised, City lost their discipline. Instead of sitting on Carrick, Milner found himself up front.\nAguero also started operating further up the pitch and City went from playing without a striker and winning the midfield battle to an orthodox 4-4-2 that left them light in the middle.\nAt the same time, Juan Mata came inside for United and created a box in midfield with Marouane Fellaini, Ander Herrera and Michael Carrick that allowed them to dominate in that area.\nToure and Fernandinho had been looking after Fellaini and Herrera but they could not deal with two men each.\nInstead of changing their shape, or going back to what had been working for them, City became ragged and looked desperate.\nUnited controlled possession and the rhythm of the game and that is why they ended up going on to score four goals and win easily.\nCity's performance told us a lot about where they are at as a team at the moment.
