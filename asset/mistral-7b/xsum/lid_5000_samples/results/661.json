This board would set the mid-term strategy, oversee the transformation process and would be tasked with creating the right conditions for the local system of care to develop successfully. It should help to transform organisational structures and management processes by promoting local decision making, local innovation and scaling up of best practices among the local  systems of care.\nDr George O'Neill:\"The panel recommends a transformation board being created and that it is linked to the Stormont executive's health and wellbeing strategy.\"\nRecommendation Eight\nThe system should identify and scale up at least two innovative projects per year where there is clear evidence of improved outcomes for patients or service users.\nDr George O'Neill: \"It is self-explanatory, there should be at least two innovative projects per year where there are clear outcomes for patients. That is common sense.\"\nRecommendation Nine\nThe minister should adopt a continuous improvement methodology to support the reform of health care towards local systems of care.\nDr George O'Neill: \"Continuous improvement means to look at what you are doing and make it better. It is about identifying what you are doing well and what you are not doing well.\"\nRecommendation Ten\nThe minister should commission a review of the governance arrangements",
