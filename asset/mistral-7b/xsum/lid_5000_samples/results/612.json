No arrests have been made, police said.\nBoth continue to be treated in hospital. Ms Khan has damage to her left eye and required two skin grafts.\nMr Muhktar, who has since been brought out of his coma, has burns across his body arms, legs, back, neck and the right side of his face as well as damage to his right eye.\nOn social media, Ms Khan said: \"I'm devastated. I keep wondering if my life will ever be the same. Acid attacks in the UK are unheard of for me.\n\"The pain was excruciating. I was struggling to close the window. My cousin struggled to get us away. I saw my clothes burn away in front of me.\"\nAccording to police the two had stopped at traffic lights during their drive when the man approached them and threw the toxic substance at Ms Khan through the window.\nThe attacker then circled around the car and threw more of the acid at Mr Muhktar, before eventually fleeing the scene.\nIn 2016-17, there were 398 victims of crimes involving \"noxious or corrosive\" substances, such as acid.
