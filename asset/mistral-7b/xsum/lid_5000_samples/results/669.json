Only Atletico Madrid have managed more in one half in this season's competition, with 17 against Kazakhstan minnows Astana.\nVirtually every club side in European football would struggle to replace Sergio Aguero and City, despite their vast riches, are no different.\nIn the Argentine talisman's absence through injury, some City fans have not been convinced that \u00a328m signing Bony is an adequate replacement.\nThe Ivorian had scored five in 24 appearances before the match in Spain, but he responded with an encouraging display.\nAs well as netting his first Champions League goal, Bony impressed with his link-up play at the focal point of City's counter-attacking set-up.\nAnd he was given a rousing ovation by the travelling supporters when he was replaced in the final five minutes.\nMan City boss Manuel Pellegrini: \"It is important to be qualified two games before the end.\n\"Now we will still try to qualify in the first position of this group and if we continue playing in this way we will have more chances.\"\nSevilla coach  Unai Emery: \"We have played against a fantastic team.\n\"They were very fast and good at converting their opportunities.
