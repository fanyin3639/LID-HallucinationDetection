The witness insisted \"there was no appetite to get rid of him (Mulcaire) by senior management\".\nMr Weatherup said he himself was not aware initially but soon found out that Mr Mulcaire \"was a phone hacker\" and had used his services 137 times, but not all for phone hacking.\nMr Goddard asked Mr Weatherup: \"From what you yourself witnessed, did Mr Coulson appear to be aware or not that Mr Mulcaire was hacking phones?\"\n\"Hacking phones was systematic at the News of the World,\" he replied.\n\"Did Mr Coulson appear or not to know that Mr Mulcaire was hacking phones?\"\n\"Andy would have known that Mulcaire was hacking phones,\" the witness replied.\nThe journalist also said that he told Mr Coulson that stories had been obtained from hacking phones.\nTelling the court that he would make a telephone gesture with his hands, Mr Weatherup added: \"I would have used a signal with my hands when Andy asked me where a story had came from.\"\nMr Goddard was also asked if Mr Coulson would have known about how stories were sourced and said: \"All editors are concerned about sourcing, yeah.
