She said she did not question it as she did not know what level pay should be in the UK.\nThe tribunal, which her lawyers said was the first successful case of its kind, found the conditions in which she was forced to live and work were a \"clear violation of her dignity\", adding \"it created an atmosphere of degradation which was offensive\".\nIt upheld several claims, including that she was harassed on the grounds of her race, subjected to unacceptable working conditions and was the victim of indirect religious discrimination.\nIt ordered the couple to pay \u00a3183,773, to make up the total she should have been paid if she had received the national minimum wage.\nMs Tirkey said while she mainly stayed at home, she accompanied the family to social gatherings and days out to places like London Zoo.\n\"But they told me the rules were not to speak to anyone. I could say, 'hello, how are you?' but on the whole I would avoid situations where I would talk to people, I had no friends,\" she said.\nShe once tried to call her family in India using the phone, but the couple stopped her, saying the bills would be too high. They said they would give her money to top up her mobile phone, but did not.\n\"In the four-and-a-half years I spent with the Chandhoks I spoke to my family about twice,\" she explained.\n\"My family accepted that, as they had the memory of those phone calls and they knew I didn't have the money to call them.\n\"I used to think about the phone calls I'd made to my family and that kept me going.
