It certainly put the lower order on the back foot. We had to rebuild without taking risks but, in the end, it wasn't enough. We were missing 30 runs.\n\"They put us under pressure in the Powerplay and they batted well all the way through. They took momentum into their batting and it worked out for them.\n\"We have a strong batting line-up but I don't think it's really clicked yet. We could score 400 really. The bowling has been off the boil but when you're hitting it well on a ground like this it becomes such a big total to defend.\"\nNorthants captain Alex Wakely told BBC Radio Northampton:\n\"We needed that win really. We have played some bit-part cricket this year and this was the first time we have managed to string it together with the bat.\n\"We weren't quite the finished article with the ball and we probably let them get too many from the position they were in.
