Nico was quick but otherwise I really enjoyed the day. I'll try to find the time and keep pushing.\n\"Red Bull are looking closer this weekend than they have for a while, so it should be close.\"\nMeanwhile, rookie Max Verstappen is set for a 10-place grid penalty in Sunday's race after his Toro Rosso team changed their Renault engine.\nThe Dutchman has exceeded his allocation of four engines this year, and is now on to his sixth.\nWhere better to blow away the cobwebs of Formula 1's summer break than arguably the greatest motor racing circuit in the world?\nCascading through Belgium's Ardennes mountains, Spa-Francorchamps encapsulates in one ecstatic 4.3-mile ribbon of asphalt why Formula 1 drivers love what they do. \"It is like a dream,\" says Lotus driver Romain Grosjean. \"It is a circuit with a soul.\"\nFast, sweeping, demanding, dangerous, scenic, carved out of what were once real roads over real contours, it is the very essence of the sport that celebrates it.\nEau Rouge, the exhilarating, flat-out left-right-left, down-up-over-a-crest, stomach-in-mouth swerves at the start of the lap, defines the place.\nAnd the rest of the lap unfolds in a series of demanding sweepers, up-and-down valleys, with the unpredictable weather sometimes changing by the minute.\nIt is an unmissable experience, for competitors and viewers alike.\nFull practice results\nBelgian GP coverage details\nSummary:\n\n### 1.
