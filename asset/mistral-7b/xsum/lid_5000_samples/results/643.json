        "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nThe U's got off to the perfect start, ending their opponents' streak of four consecutive clean sheets with the opener inside eight minutes through George Maris, who nodded past Jake Kean from close range following Piero Mingoia's fine cross from the right.\nCambridge could have already been behind at that point, with Coulthirst scuffing an effort straight to goalkeeper Will Norris in the fifth minute.\nThe visitors were level two minutes before half-time in fortuitous circumstances when defender Leon Legge diverted Rhys Bennett's nod down past his own goalkeeper Norris.\nSteve Evans' side were ahead moments before the hour-mark when defender Krystian Pearce was allowed a free header from Joel Byrom's corner.\nThe result was put beyond doubt 17 minutes from the end when Norris saved Hayden White's low effort, only for on-loan Peterborough striker Coulthirst to mark his debut with a goal by turning home the rebound.\nReport supplied by the Press Association.\nMatch ends, Cambridge United 1, Mansfield Town 3.\nSecond Half ends, Cambridge United 1, Mansfield Town 3.\nFoul by Pat Hoban (Mansfield Town).\nLeon Legge (Cambridge United) wins a free kick in the defensive half.\nSubstitution, Mansfield Town.
