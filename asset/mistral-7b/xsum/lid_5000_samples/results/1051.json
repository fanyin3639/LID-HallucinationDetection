Singapore is seeking to benefit from the prosperity of the hinterland by becoming the trading and services hub for the region.\"\nObservers say Singapore has had the advantage of being part of an economic agreement in ASEAN without the political baggage.\nWith a small population, Singapore has always had to look elsewhere to fill jobs. Four out of ten people on this island are foreigners. This has brought with it its own problems, and Singapore's government is trying to address this. But Singapore can pick and choose who it wants to let in to the country.\n\"In a sense, Singapore has what Britain wants,\" says Simon Long, a British journalist based in Singapore with The Economist.\n\"If you look at Singapore's situation and ASEAN, they have a single market, they have a free trade agreement, but there's no free movement of labour.\"\nSingapore has always used its neighbours to chart its own course of success.\nBeing part of ASEAN has been useful for Singapore - it's sold its products in this marketplace, and found many of its workers amongst the region's labour force.\nOf course ASEAN has its limitations - its critics say it is a toothless organisation and has barely achieved anything in its five decade-long history, barring perhaps the nudging of Myanmar towards a democratic transition.\nBut central to the idea of ASEAN is the policy of staying out of each other's business. And being part of an economic union without the political strings attached isn't an option the UK currently has.\nSummary:\nSingapore is a small country with no natural resources. It is a city state and is located in a vulnerable position in the region. It has a small population. Singapore has always looked beyond its shores to thrive.\nSingapore is a founding member of ASEAN. Singapore has had to forge partnership"
