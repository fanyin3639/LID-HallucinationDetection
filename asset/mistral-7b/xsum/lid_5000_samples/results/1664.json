        "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nSaffie Roussos was among 22 people killed when Salman Abedi detonated a homemade bomb at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester Arena on 22 May.\nThe eight-year-old from Lancashire had been at the venue with her mother Lisa and sister, Ashlee Bromwich, 26, who were both injured in the attack.\nThe service was the last of the funerals for the victims.\nLive updates on this story\nHundreds of mourners filed into the cathedral, some wearing pink, Saffie's favourite colour, and others carrying a single rose, as requested by the family, in tribute to their daughter's middle name.\nSaffie's coffin was also covered in roses.\nDuring the service, her father wiped away tears as he paid tribute to his \"stunning, stunning\" daughter, and said he was \"honoured to be her dad\".\n\"I just want to thank everybody for coming to support out family in this difficult time. The Manchester community, family and friends have been fantastic.\nHe said Saffie was \"a superstar in the making\".\n\"To become something in life, you need to have that something. That spark. That charisma. The ones that make it are born with it, they get it from the very beginning. Saffie had that.\"\nThe cortege left Wythenshawe Hospital, where Mrs Roussos is still receiving treatment for her injuries.\nMrs Roussos has undergone multiple operations and was placed in an induced coma by doctors.\nA letter from her sister Ashlee was read out in which she wrote: \"I close my eyes and I see your face with your brown eyes burning.\n\"I imagine how you run up and jump into my arms. I see you everywhere, with your smile from ear to ear.\n\"You lived to entertain, and to keep us all smiling. Something about you got everyone's attention. Your silliness and jokes are the highlights of my memories.\n\"Whatever you wanted, you were going to make it happen. I wish I could do you justice with my words.\n\"Nothing more, nothing less could I have ever wanted in a baby sister.\"\nA montage of photos, set to the music of Grande's hit One Last Time, was also shown before being released by her family and friends.\nThe YouTube video clip shows a series of photographs and the family said they hoped it would be liked and shared to fulfil her dream of becoming famous.\nRev Govender said 22 decorative bees would be placed in the cathedral's furniture as a memorial to the victims of the bombing.\nHe asked Mrs Roussos to hold one of the model bees as he dedicated it to Saffie.\nHe said the service was a \"poignant moment\" not just for Saffie's family but also for the people of Manchester.\nA short service was also held at Holy Trinity Church in Tarleton, where Saffie went to school, for those who could not travel to Manchester.\nThe Rev David Craven said: \"There was a real desire among some in the community to have a gathering to mark Saffie's life.\n\"We wanted to open the doors of the church, which will be open all day for quiet reflection, and collective grief.\n\"You can't even begin to imagine what the families are going through.
