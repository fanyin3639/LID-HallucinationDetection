The polls may continue to suggest there'll be no clear winner in three weeks time but coalition is far from inevitable.\nThat's not only because voters may react against the idea of deals and pacts and vote to give one party that elusive majority.\nIt's also because it's perfectly possible that the election will produce a minority government in which one party governs alone and not in coalition and seeks not one deal for five years but a series of deals vote-by-Parliamentary vote.\nNick Clegg knows this but he also knows that if there are to be deals all potential partners are not equal. He knows that dealing with him would be much more attractive to David Cameron or Ed Miliband than dealing with Farage or Salmond.\nWhat's more, many voters wrongly wrote the Lib Dems off before this campaign began. Despite the slump in their poll ratings they are likely to be much more significant players in the next Parliament than the new kids on the political block - UKIP and the Greens.\nEven if Nick Clegg's appeal today does not produce a boost in his party's ratings, his party's on course to win between 20 and 40 MPs.\nIn contrast Nigel Farage has talked of gaining three or four seats and Natalie Bennett knows her party could struggle to hold the one seat they have. Some believe both parties could end up with no MPs at all.\nThat's why today Nick Clegg's pitch to the nation was to say, in effect, \"if you don't like me have you thought about the alternatives?\"\nSo, if you do agree with Nick on that don't be at all surprised if after 7 May he still has a place at the cabinet table.\nSummary:\nNick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has suggested that the next government should be a coalition of conscience, rather than a coalition of grievance.\nHe was speaking in response to Nigel Farage, leader of UKIP, who had earlier made an alternative pitch for his party to have a",
