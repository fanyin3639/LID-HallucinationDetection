It is not preparing the ground for a referendum on EU membership, in contrast with Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservatives in the UK.\nBut the Dutch government website said the letter, presented by Foreign Minister Frans Timmermans, would feed into broader discussions on EU powers in Europe.\n\"The Netherlands is convinced that the time of an 'ever closer union' in every possible policy area is behind us,\" the website said, reporting the letter.\nIn his landmark Europe speech in January, Mr Cameron also challenged the EU's \"ever closer union\" commitment - a phrase used in the Lisbon Treaty, which is the 27-nation bloc's rulebook.\nThe Netherlands, Germany and Sweden are often seen as close to UK positions on the EU, especially on market liberalisation, free trade and budget austerity in the current crisis.\nBut there is also concern in the EU that British Euroscepticism may result in the UK leaving, while eurozone countries integrate their economic policies.\nThe Dutch letter did not call for EU treaty change, but said there were various \"issues which the Netherlands believes could be left more or less entirely to member states: halting the further harmonisation of social security systems; working conditions, which should only be regulated in broad outline; no EU regulation of media pluralism; flood risk management should only be harmonised at European level for truly trans-boundary water courses; phase out the EU programmes for school milk and school fruit.\"\nIt said strong European co-operation was still vital in responding to the economic crisis and challenges such as energy, climate change, asylum and migration, the internal market and defence.\nThe full text of the letter was carried by the Open Europe think tank on Friday.\nCommenting on the Dutch review of EU powers, Open Europe director Mats Persson said it was \"broadly positive news for Cameron's chances of achieving a new deal in Europe, and shows that discontent with the EU status quo is not simply a UK phenomenon.\n\"Countries like Sweden and Germany are also far more likely to be persuaded down the reform path if the Dutch are prepared to take a lead, with the UK.
