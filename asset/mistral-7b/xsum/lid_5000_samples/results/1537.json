The CAA always advises consumers to ensure they book Atol-protected air holidays and consumers who choose to book an Atol-protected flight or holiday with the company during this time will continue to be protected by the Atol scheme.\"\nMonarch says Atol offers consumers security \"where a flight and accommodation have been booked together, some flights booked separately and applies in certain other circumstances\".\nEarlier this year Greybull bought a division of Tata Steel, as well as 140 M Local convenience stores from Morrisons, which subsequently went into administration.\nA former managing director of Monarch, Tim Jeans, told BBC Breakfast the company had been having difficulties for some time.\n\"They certainly have to come up with the money and the investment to satisfy the CAA in those 12 days, otherwise the future does look rather bleak.\n\"One has to trust in the reassurances the company has given, and hope that Monarch, which has a great heritage as a British airline, carries on well into the future.\"\nAnd the Independent's travel editor Simon Calder told the BBC that Monarch was a \"much smaller and less agile\" operation than the giants of low-cost aviation, Ryanair and Easyjet.\nHe added: \"The fall in sterling means many of Monarch's costs, the leases on its aircraft, the fuel in its tanks, are much more expensive and there is generally a weakness in demand.\"\nSummary:\nMonarch Airlines has secured a 12-day extension to its Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) licence.\nThe company said it had secured additional funds from shareholders and was close to announcing its biggest ever investment.\nThe news came just ahead of a midnight deadline for the renewal of",
