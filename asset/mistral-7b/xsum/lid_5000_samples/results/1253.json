        "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nDet Con James Sloan said the man - who cannot be named for legal reasons - also told police about people who were interested in harming Mr Carroll.\nThe police officer was giving evidence at the trial of Ross Monaghan.\nThe 30-year-old denies denies shooting Mr Carroll dead at the Asda car park in Robroyston, Glasgow, in January 2010.\nThe jury was told that DC Sloan spoke to the man - who was an associate of Mr Carroll - after the shooting.\nHe refused to give a formal statement, but did give information to the inquiry.\nDefence QC Derek Ogg asked DC Sloan: \"Did this man say he was no longer an associate because he understood that Gerbil had offered \u00a3100,000 for a hit on him?\" The detective replied: \"That's correct.\"\nThe man also gave police information about a number of people interested in doing serious harm to Mr Carroll, DC Sloan said.\nMr Monaghan's legal team has lodged a special defence blaming eight men, including William Paterson who is believed to be in Spain, for the shooting.\nThe jury heard that DC Sloan also spoke to Scott Bennett, a nightclub owner, about a mobile phone number of interest to the inquiry.\nHe took a statement from Mr Bennett in a supermarket car park in Bearsden on 10 September 2010, because he refused to go to a police station.\nAdvocate depute Iain McSporran, prosecuting, asked DC Sloan: \"Did he give information about a mobile phone number ending in 1210 that the investigation was interested in?\" He replied: \"Yes.\"\nMr Bennett's statement was read out in court and in it he said that he was looking for a roofer to repair a leak in the roof of his Clydebank nightclub.\nHe said in the statement: \"I got the number from a mate of mine for Ross Monaghan. He's a pal of mine. I know him as Hugo. It's rhyming slang. Hugo Boss, Ross.\"\nMr Bennett told DC Sloan that he was called twice by the number ending 1210, which he believed was Mr Monaghan's number.\nGillian Rankin from Addiewell Prison told the court that two days after the shooting of Mr Carroll, Mr Monaghan and William Paterson visited Paul Lyons in the jail.\nShe told the court that all visitors to the prison have to be photographed and fingerprinted and go through airport-style security before being allowed access to prisoners. There are also sniffer dogs patrolling the jail.\nMr Ogg asked her: \"Any visitor would be aware of this?\" She replied: \"Yes.\"\nIt is alleged that while masked and acting with others, Mr Monaghan murdered Mr Carroll by repeatedly discharging loaded handguns at him, shooting him on the head and body.\nHe is further accused of, while acting with others, attempting to defeat the ends of justice by disposing of a revolver, pistol and ammunition within undergrowth in Coatbridge and Airdrie, both Lanarkshire.\nIt is also claimed a car - bearing false number plates YF 55 EZZ - was set on fire.\nMr Monaghan also faces a number of firearms charges.\nHe denies all the charges against him and has lodged a special defence of incrimination against eight men.\nThe trial before judge Lord Brailsford continues.\nSummary:\nThe passage is about the trial of Ross Monaghan who is accused of shooting dead Gerbil Carroll in January 2010. The police officer, DC Sloan, gave evidence about the man who was an associate of Mr Carroll. He also told about the people who were interested in doing serious"
