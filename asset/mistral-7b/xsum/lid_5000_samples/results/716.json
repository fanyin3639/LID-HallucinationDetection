Mercury has one, as do a lot of the moons of the giant planets. Even some big asteroids are likely to have one, too.\nThe dust phenomenon has puzzled researchers for decades. Apollo astronauts reported seeing a diffuse glow above the lunar horizon just before sunrise. The speculation has been that this glow was caused by electrically charged dust particles being lifted from the Moon's surface by ultraviolet light from the Sun.

On the Moon, it\u2019s very rough. It\u2019s kinda evil. It follows electric field lines; it works its way into equipment. One of the questions about dust on the Moon is an engineering question: how do you design things so that they can survive the dust environment.\u201d\nApollo astronauts found the chaffing moondust would stick to everything. And there are concerns that if such material were breathed in, it could lead to respiratory problems.\nHaving been launched by its Minotaur V rocket, LADEE will be sent on a long spiral out to the Moon. This will take about a month.  A further month will then be needed to commission the spacecraft before its altitude is taken down to as low as 20km above the surface for a 100-day phase of science observations.\nLADEE will end its mission by crashing into the Moon.\nAs well as its three science instruments, LADEE carries a demonstration laser telecommunications payload.\nThis system promises a big jump in data transmission rates.
