I think we might see Spectre modelled along those sorts of lines.\"\nFirst appearing in the Ian Fleming novel Thunderball (1961), Spectre is an acronym for the clumsily-titled Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion.\nHeaded by Ernst Stavro Blofeld, it began as a small enterprise of like-minded criminals. But, as the book and film series developed, it grew to include the criminal masterminds of the Gestapo, the Mafia and Smersh (among others) to create a diabolical - but, crucially, apolitical - empire of evil.\nIt appeared in three of the 007 novels, but gained greater prominence in the film series where Blofeld, with his white Persian cat, played the antagonist seven times. The films also saw the organisation become more closely aligned with the Cold War-era Soviet Union than Fleming had envisaged.\nIts logo was an octopus, which is echoed in the first poster for the new Bond film.\nSkyfall is the highest-grossing film of all time in the UK and made more than $1.1bn (\u00c2\u00a3705m) at the worldwide box office.\nBroccoli told the BBC the budget for Spectre was \"higher\" than for Skyfall. \"Obviously we have a hell of a challenge ahead of us - we want to make this the best Bond  movie ever.\n\"All the money is going to be on the screen as always.
