Phillips' shot deflected towards Rondon, who found the net but was ruled offside.\nMorrison made the breakthrough a minute later, scoring his third goal in five games as he tapped Chadli's pass beyond Lee Grant.\nStoke struggled to keep up with the home side in the first half, with Morrison and Chadli combining well to outpace the Potters' defence.\nHowever, after half-time, it was the visitors who started strongly only for their finishing to let them down - Erik Pieters fluffing a simple header from six yards out.\nStoke had conceded in the 90th minute on the last two occasions the two sides had met and came close again here, but Joe Allen's excellent late block denied Livermore, who was Albion's only permanent signing in the transfer window.\nThe boos for Berahino began before the match as he warmed up with his teammates and continued as he pulled on a Stoke shirt for the first time.\nHis \u00a312m move in January after seven years with the Baggies left the fans unimpressed, but the striker hardly saw any of the ball after he was introduced midway through the second half.\nHis one significant touch in the area, under pressure from the West Brom defence, saw him slip over the ball and allow his former team to counter-attack, which drew wry cheers from the crowd.\nStoke's main attack came from Allen, who was sprightly, but the visitors were unable to make the breakthrough in a tense final 10 minutes.\nThere was no handshake between the managers as the game ended, with Tony Pulis walking straight down the tunnel while an unimpressed Mark Hughes stayed on the sidelines.\nBerahino, however, received an arm around the shoulders from his former team-mate Rondon.\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"We're pleased.

Phillips' shot deflected towards Rondon, who found the net but was ruled offside.\nMorrison made the breakthrough a minute later, scoring his third goal in five games as he tapped Chadli's pass beyond Lee Grant.\nStoke struggled to keep up with the home side in the first half, with Morrison and Chadli combining well to outpace the Potters' defence.\nHowever, after half-time, it was the visitors who started strongly only for their finishing to let them down - Erik Pieters fluffing a simple header from six yards out.\nStoke had conceded in the 90th minute on the last two occasions the two sides had met and came close again here, but Joe Allen's excellent late block denied Livermore, who was Albion's only permanent signing in the transfer window.\nThe boos for Berahino began before the match as he warmed up with his teammates and continued as he pulled on a Stoke shirt for the first time.\nHis \u00a312m move in January after seven years with the Baggies left the fans unimpressed, but the striker hardly saw any of the ball after he was introduced midway through the second half.\nHis one significant touch in the area, under pressure from the West Brom defence, saw him slip over the ball and allow his former team to counter-attack, which drew wry cheers from the crowd.\nStoke's main attack came from Allen, who was sprightly, but the visitors were unable to make the breakthrough in a tense final 10 minutes.\nThere was no handshake between the managers as the game ended, with Tony Pulis walking straight down the tunnel while an unimpressed Mark Hughes stayed on the sidelines.\nBerahino, however, received an arm around the shoulders from his former team-mate Rondon.\nWest Brom manager Tony Pulis: \"We're pleased.
