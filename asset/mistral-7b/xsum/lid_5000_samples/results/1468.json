We'd been to see a GP and given antibiotics.\nBut I was so worried about how ill he was that I called my parents to come over - more for reassurance, I suppose. I wanted someone to say he was ok.\nThey took one look at him and said I should call an ambulance straight away. I started to panic. He was not breathing properly. I was very scared.\nA first responder arrived at our house and one of the first things he did after giving Peter oxygen was prick Peter's finger for a blood test.\nWithin 30 seconds of coming he had diagnosed him as having type 1 diabetes - a condition where the body doesn't produce enough insulin.\nI was told he was in a DKA - diabetic ketoacidosis - which is when your body starts to shut down if you haven't had insulin and it can lead to organ failure.\nThe ambulance journey to the University Hospital of Wales didn't take long from our house and soon Peter was in critical care in the high dependency unit, hooked up to a drip and oxygen.\nStuart went home at midnight to be with our eight-year-old daughter Lia.

That led to too much pressure on his organs.\nThey did all sorts of tests and he was put on dialysis. They came to us and said there were signs of damage to the brain and the outlook didn't look good.\nOn the day he died, it's all a bit of a blur... but they said he's not likely to make any recovery. The majority of the brain had been damaged and the machines were keeping him alive.\nHad the GP diagnosed him as having type 1 diabetes, he would have been given insulin and we wouldn't have had to go through all of this.\nIt was so hard to say goodbye to Peter.

He kept trying to move the oxygen mask and he was just so tried.\nAbout 6am one of the nurses walked past his room and she said to me \"get your head down\". I said \"I'm ok\" but she insisted: \"He's ok, get your head down.\"\nI was sat next to him and put my head down on a little pillow. I don't know what woke me up about 10 minutes later... I got a feeling.\nI woke with a start, looked up and he didn't look right - he looked grey. I called the nurse and said \"what's going on? This doesn't look right\".\nShe came over, lifted his eyes... I don't know if she pushed the buzzer but within 30 seconds all hell broke loose.\nSomeone said \"he's really not well, talk to him\" and I just started screaming \"come on Peter, I'm here, mummy's here\".\nNurses came from everywhere, alarms were going off, doctors came in shouting for a crash team. One was doing chest compressions. They were trying to save him because he'd had a cardiac arrest.\nI was shouting at him all the time to wake up and telling him \"mummy is here\".\nA nurse said she would call my husband Stuart. He came as our house is only two minutes around the corner. We just watched in disbelief as a team of goodness knows how many doctors and nurses managed to restart his heart.\nThey took him to surgery, off to try to stabilise him. We went up to the surgical department, just waiting, waiting, waiting.\nJust 24 hours earlier, on New Year's Day 2015, my son Peter - fun-loving, everyone's friend and so clever - had been at our home in Whitchurch, Cardiff.\nHe had been ill with a chest infection. We'd been to see a GP and given antibiotics.\nBut I was so worried about how ill he was that I called my parents to come over - more for reassurance, I suppose. I wanted someone to say he was ok.\nThey took one look at him and said I should call an ambulance straight away. I started to panic. He was not breathing properly. I was very scared.\nA first responder arrived at our house and one of the first things he did after giving Peter oxygen was prick Peter's finger for a blood test.\nWithin 30 seconds of coming he had diagnosed him as having type 1 diabetes - a condition where the body doesn't produce enough insulin.\nI was told he was in a DKA - diabetic ketoacidosis - which is when your body starts to shut down if you haven't had insulin and it can lead to organ failure.\nThe ambulance journey to the University Hospital of Wales didn't take long from our house and soon Peter was in critical care in the high dependency unit, hooked up to a drip and oxygen.\nStuart went home at midnight to be with our eight-year-old daughter Lia. I remember saying: \"Peter will be fine, come back in the morning.\"\nI had no idea how bad he was.\nAfter he had the cardiac arrest, the doctors and nurses saved him but when we were able to see him again we could tell his poor little body had been through the mill and back.\nHe was in the intensive care unit for four days. We sat by his side the whole time but he never really came back.\nThey said the DKA had gone too far and even though he'd been given medication, his body was already in shutdown mode and he couldn't fight it. That led to too much pressure on his organs.\nThey did all sorts of tests and he was put on dialysis. They came to us and said there were signs of damage to the brain and the outlook didn't look good.\nOn the day he died, it's all a bit of a blur... but they said he's not likely to make any recovery. The majority of the brain had been damaged and the machines were keeping him alive.\nHaving watched him go through all that, we decided to let him go.\nThe doctors said he had a very rare condition called type 1 diabetes.\nThey said it was very rare for someone to have it in their 20s.\nThey said it was a condition that was hard to diagnose.",
