The question is how to connect the chips together and do it fast. You want your results to come back to you very quickly.\n\"With existing technology given the amount of massive data that is flying round the network it is very difficult. With this new technology you can make this fast search happen in a way that makes economic sense.\"\nEach chip contains a number of channels - IBM would not specify the number - that can each handle light-encoded data at speeds of up to 25 gigabits per second (Gbps).\nBy combining these together the firm says data can be transferred hundreds of times faster still.\nIBM began producing the first chips containing the nanophotonic technology earlier this year at an existing semiconductor factory.\nDr Assefa said this was the culmination of more than a decade of research designed to help internet-based products cope with demand.\n\"Its driven by applications and services that continue to grow, be it search, video content, cloud computing, social networks, business analytics - all these use huge amount of data,\" he said.\n\"For our computer servers to keep up with this growth, so that we can actually make sense of the data through analytics and so forth, we need to have a new technology.\"\nHe added that IBM had yet to decide how to bring the product to market, but that it should become available to customers within \"the next few years\".\nOne London-based computer expert said the development should help light-based data transmission go mainstream in server farms.\n\"This is not a revolution, but it is a significant evolution,\" commented Prof Alan Woodward, visiting professor at the University of Surrey's computing department.\n\"You could already do this using expensive parts but what IBM has done is said they can stamp these chips out for a much cheaper price in a factory in the same way that microprocessors are made.\n\"There should be demand from data centres where there's a need to shift around huge amounts of information and the difficulty in doing that at high enough speeds is creating a bottleneck at the moment.\"\nSummary:\nThe firm says it should offer a way to move large amounts of information between processors in computer servers at higher speeds than at present.\nThese provide computing power and data used by apps and other net services.\nOne third-party expert said the significance of the innovation was that it was much cheaper than other options."
