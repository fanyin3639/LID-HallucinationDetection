        "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nVictory looked set to go to Bath, who held the Chiefs at bay until a Gareth Steenson penalty on the hour.\nSemesa Rokoduguni's first-half try and two penalties from fly-half George Ford gave them an 11-0 lead at the break.\nBut, with Bath down to 14 men after losing all available props, Exeter capitalised and replacement Short crossed twice in the last nine minutes.\nExeter climb above Bath to third courtesy of their fifth straight Premiership victory, which was also their first at the Rec in the competition.\nBath found themselves on the losing side in a Premiership home match for the first time since 1 April.\nFor the majority of the contest, Todd Blackadder's side looked set to continue their impressive home form as the Chiefs struggled to find a way through.\nBut as Bath lost front rows Nathan Catt, who was earlier selected in England's 33-man training squad, Max Lahiff and Nick Auterac, referee Craig Maxwell-Keys ordered uncontested scrums.\nAuterac failed a head injury assessment with six minutes remaining which presented Exeter with the chance to make a man's advantage tell and ultimately resulted in Short's second decisive try.\nBath first team coach Toby Booth told BBC Radio Bristol:\n\"What we have to be really honest about is when you play against top four sides, the margins are very slight.\n\"Exeter are a very good side, we know that, but losing three props and going to uncontested scrums hasn't helped anyone, so from that point of view it's very disappointing.\n\"But you need to take your chances and ultimately they took the two chances that they had and we didn't take the two that we had.\n\"We're disappointed, but if you think what happened down there, I'm sure they were disappointed at home and us stealing it at the death, so I suppose it's honours even.\"\nExeter Chiefs head coach Rob Baxter told BBC Radio Devon:\n\"I thought Bath were very good for 50 minutes of the game and controlled most areas.\n\"Their energy, enthusiasm and competiveness was at a level above ours.\n\"That was all we talked about at half-time, we didn't really talk about technique or any tactical switches, we just said 'come on, we're not showing the attitude that's required here today to win a game of top four Premiership rugby'. That was the biggest shift we made.\n\"They stepped up attitude-wise, but they are going to get some questions asked on Monday as to why it took to 40 minutes for that to surface.\"\nBath: Homer; Rokoduguni, Joseph, Tapuai, Brew; Ford (co-capt), Fotuali'i; Catt, Dunn, Lahiff, Garvey (co-capt), Attwood, Ellis, Louw, Mercer.\nReplacements: van Vuuren, Auterac, Knight, Stooke, Grant, Allinson, Clark, Watson.\nExeter: Dollman; Nowell, Devoto, Hill, Woodburn; Steenson (capt), Chudley; Moon, Yeandle, Francis, Lees, Hill, Dennis, Armand, Waldrom.\nReplacements: Cowan-Dickie, Rimmer, Holmes, Atkins, Horstmann, Maunder, Simmonds, Short.\nFor the latest rugby union news follow @bbcrugbyunion on Twitter.\nSummary:\nVictory looked set to go to Bath, who held the Chiefs at bay until a Gareth Steenson penalty on the hour.\nSemesa Rokoduguni's first-half try and two penalties from fly-half George Ford gave them an 11-0 lead at the"
