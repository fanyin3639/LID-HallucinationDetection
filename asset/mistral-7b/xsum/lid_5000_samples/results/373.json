Choosing Fara Williams in a midfield role for the semi-final defeat might have been his biggest mistake.\nHe took risks with his pre-match barbs towards opposition managers yet they were soon forgotten once his team had won, especially with a first victory over France in 43 years to reach the semi-finals.\nSampson enhanced his reputation again by becoming the first England boss since Sir Alf Ramsey to reach two successive tournament semi-finals, but it will be of little consolation. And with whispers about another FA role in the pipeline, it may yet be his final tournament with the Lionesses.\nKaren Bardsley - 7\nBardsley has been prone to the odd error in recent major tournaments, but she was more solid in the three games she played in the Netherlands and did not concede a goal.\nPart of that was down to the defence in front of her, which former England goalkeeper Rachel Brown-Finnis called the \"white wall\". Yet she should also take credit for playing with a broken leg for 14 minutes in the win over France, which ended her tournament, before being replaced by Siobhan Chamberlain.\nSiobhan Chamberlain - 7\nDeputised well for the injured Bardsley, and the England defence seemed to prefer passing back to her given her superior kicking ability.

The right-back was seemingly indefatigable as she combined barnstorming runs forward with goal-line clearances, and her desire to drive the team forward was always evident on the pitch, almost over-spilling at the final whistle against the hosts after her penalty complaints were turned down by the referee.\nBronze would comfortably get into any team in world football, and the only question is whether she would be able to make more of an impact further forward.\nMillie Bright - 9\nAnother player who came away with huge credit, particularly as it was the 23-year-old's tournament debut.

That was totally undeserved, but she will be a rock in the centre of the defence for years to come.\nSteph Houghton - 6.5\nA mixed tournament for the captain, who was outshone in central defence by her younger partner. At times she looked ponderous, and with a lack of genuine speed, opposition teams such as France were quick to target her.
