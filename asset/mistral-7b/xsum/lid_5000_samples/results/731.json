        "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nSummer signing Ajose bundled home Athletic's opener just before half-time and netted the winner, also from close range, on 74 minutes, moments after Kieron Morris had fired Walsall level.\nWalsall had the best of the opening half-hour but Charlton goalkeeper Declan Rudd made a superb double save on 29 minutes, foiling Simeon Jackson's point-blank strike and Morris' follow-up.\nBack came Charlton as Ajose's classy 20-yard chip clipped the top of the bar.\nThe Addicks claimed a 42nd-minute lead as Ajose netted home from close range after Josh Magennis nodded down Ricky Holmes' inviting cross.\nWalsall levelled on 72 minutes as Rudd allowed Morris' speculative 20-yard strike to find the bottom corner.\nBut the Addicks were back in front within two minutes as Magennis raced past James O'Connor and crossed for Ajose to poke home from a couple of yards.\nWalsall almost levelled deep into stoppage time but Rudd pulled off a spectacular save to tip Jackson's volley onto the bar.\nReport supplied by the Press Association.\nMatch ends, Walsall 1, Charlton Athletic 2.\nSecond Half ends, Walsall 1, Charlton Athletic 2.\nCorner,  Walsall.
