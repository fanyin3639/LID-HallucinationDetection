Human behaviour is not constant around the globe.\n\"But it's a very, very good base to build on, to provide initial estimates.\"\nThe work, published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, is part of a big and growing research field exploring what online activity can reveal about human behaviour and other real-world phenomena.\nFederico Botta, the PhD student who led the analysis, said the mobile phone-based approach had advantages over other methods for estimating crowd sizes.\n\"This is very quick,\" Mr Botta told BBC News. \"It does not rely on human judgement, it only relies on having the data related to mobile phones, or Twitter activity.\"\nWithin two months of mobile data provided by Telecom Italia as part of its Big Data Challenge, Mr Botta and his colleagues concentrated on Linate Airport and the San Siro football stadium, home to both AC Milan and Inter Milan.\nThey compared the number of people known to be in those two places, based on flight schedules and football ticket sales, with three measures of mobile phone activity: the number of phonecalls and text messages, the amount of internet use, and volume of tweets.\n\"What we saw was that indeed these activities\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 had a strikingly similar behaviour to the number of people,\" Mr Botta said.\nThis may not seem surprising - but particularly within the football stadium, the team saw such a reliable pattern that they could make predictions.\nThere were 10 football matches during the analysis period.
