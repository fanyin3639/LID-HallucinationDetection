Why did I wake up at 5am and want a drink? It was not normal.\n\"People want to know if there is any medication they can take when they have an illness and it was a relief.\"\nIn a wide-ranging interview, Gascoigne also spoke openly about:\n\"I am happy in life, I am happy with the way things are going,\" said Gascoigne.\n\"I know it won't last forever because I know what the press can write. The lies written about me over the last two years have been horrendous and you have to be strong to get through that.\n\"I accept that is going to be for life for me. I admit I haven't dealt with it properly sometimes and hit the drink, it hasn't been month-long benders, it has been a few days and I have paid the consequences.\n\"I might drink tomorrow, I might not. Hopefully I don't. When I drink, the only thing I am doing is making things bad for myself.\"\n\"I am a nice guy, I would not treat anyone the way I have been treated,\" said Gascoigne, who starred for England as they reached the semi-finals of both the 1990 World Cup and the 1996 European Championship.\n\"I don't play football any more so I have to earn money other ways. I get good jobs and the press write lies and I lose that job because they think I am in rehab, or injecting myself with heroin or jumping off a pier, or falling out of a casino drunk - but I am just sitting in the back garden doing nothing.\n\"I have to ring the lawyer again and it takes two years and in that two years I have lost money again.\n\"I went from being on the pitch all the time to being in courtrooms. I should become a lawyer and defend myself.\n\"Everything is good at the moment but I know what is going to happen in time.\"\nFormer England defender Kenny Sansom recently revealed he had contemplated suicide after becoming homeless because of his alcoholism, admitting in a Sunday Mirror interview he fears he will never stop drinking.\nGascoigne said: \"I have paid about \u00a3300K of my money.
