Initially, the CV1 is available in 20 countries.\nCustomers are limited to buying one headset each. Bundled with the headset are the Eve: Valkyrie and Lucky's Tale video games as well as a movement-tracking sensor, cables, a media remote and an Xbox One controller.\nIn late 2015, Oculus announced that special controllers that let people interact more easily with virtual worlds would be delayed until the third quarter of 2016. No guidance has been given on how much these controllers will cost.\nAnalyst Piers Harding-Rolls from IHS Technology said although the price was high it might not hit sales because of who was looking to buy it.\n\"Early adopting PC gamers are likely to be less price sensitive,\" he said. \"This is the type of audience that spends $400-$500 every other year on graphics cards and large amounts on games.\"\nHe added: \"We do not expect PlayStation VR to launch at this high a price point, which gives Sony a chance to establish a lead in this opening phase of consumer VR.\"\nBy contrast, many expect the HTC Vive headset to cost more than the CV1 Rift.\nOculus founder Palmer Luckey apologised for misleading customers over the price of the Rift during a Q&A session on the Reddit social news site.\n\"My answer was ill-prepared, and mentally, I was contrasting $349 with $1,500, not our internal estimate that hovered close to $599 - that is why I said it was in roughly the same ballpark,\" he wrote.\n\"Our biggest failing was assuming we had been clear enough about setting expectations.\"\nOn social media others pointed out that anyone who put down cash for a development version of the Rift headset when it launched on Kickstarter had now got a bargain, as the firm has promised to give these backers a headset free.\nA survey out earlier this week suggested many who are tempted to buy the VR headset will have to upgrade their home computer to satisfy its computational requirements.\nThe study, backed by graphics chip-maker Nvidia, suggested only 1% of PCs worldwide had the CPU horsepower to give people a smooth VR experience.\nRead more of our CES articles and follow the BBC team covering the show on Twitter.\nSummary:\nThe CV1 version of the headset is now officially open and the device can be bought via the Oculus website.\nAnyone ordering the headset now should have it shipped to them in March, said the Facebook-owned firm.\nThe arrival of the headset has been long-awaited since it"
