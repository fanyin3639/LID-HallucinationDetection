        "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nThe flashpoint arrived when Storer launched into Jamie McGuire with a full-blooded challenge on the halfway line in front of the visiting bench.\nReferee Charles Breakspear wasted little time in brandishing a straight red card, with Robins manager Gary Johnson sent from the dugout in the aftermath.\nCheltenham were rocked, but the Stags - beaten just once in their previous 12 League Two outings, could not find a way through as Ben Whiteman scuffed horribly off target from two presentable openings.\nThe hosts began the second half on the front foot with Mansfield skipper Lee Collins getting a vital touch on Will Boyle's on-target header shortly before Liam Davis hit the crossbar straight from a corner on 51 minutes.\nWhiteman miscued again from 18 yards just before the hour and Mansfield substitute Shaquile Coulthirst lifted the ball over from inside the box late on as Cheltenham secured a fourth successive clean sheet.\nMatch report supplied by the Press Association.\nMatch ends, Cheltenham Town 0, Mansfield Town 0.\nSecond Half ends, Cheltenham Town 0, Mansfield Town 0.\nAttempt blocked.
