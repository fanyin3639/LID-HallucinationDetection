Against West Ham, it was the system he played and the determination his players showed which won the day.\nBoth Ritchie and Isaac Hayden were exceptional with their dogged work in midfield, especially ex-Bournemouth winger Ritchie.\nHe forced midfielder Declan Rice into losing possession which resulted in the opener. The loose ball found its way to Merino, who played a beautifully-weighted pass for Atsu. The Ghana winger squared the ball for Joselu, who poked in under pressure.\nThe Magpies increased their lead when Scot Ritchie's cross from the right found defender Clark, who nodded in. And then Mitrovic, perhaps lucky not to see a card for a stray arm which caught Manuel Lanzini, added the third after Newcastle had again pinched the ball from West Ham in their final third.\nRice, 18, was taken off at half-time, seemingly because his confidence was shattered after the mistake that led to Newcastle's opener.\nHe was consoled by Hart straight after the goal, but the teenager knew the significance of his mistake in a side that was also short of confidence.\nTheir best chances came after the break when Rob Elliot blocked Aaron Cresswell's effort and took the sting out of Javier Hernandez's follow-up before Clark cleared the ball off the line.\nThe international break will give Hammers boss Slaven Bilic time to work out why it is not clicking for his side.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nNewcastle manager Rafael Benitez: \"When you are losing it is difficult, when you are winning everyone is happy.\n\"We won with everyone trying so hard.
