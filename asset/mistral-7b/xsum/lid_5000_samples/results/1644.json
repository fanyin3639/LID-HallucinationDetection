Make sure you have enough wood to burn and it's not too breezy.\nNo need for Ray this time, Newsbeat's Nesta McGregor can guide you through his Stone Age transformation.\nYou will need: Berries, herbs, fish... basically anything you can find that won't kill you or that you can kill. Plus, the strength not to eat everything you find.\nAdam Hendley told Newsbeat that after spending 30 years training in bushcraft, a modern-day man will only have skill set of a Neanderthal toddler.\nThe Stone Age diet for the cast of 10,000 BC consisted of berries - mainly cranberries, blueberries and sloe berries.\nThey were apparently nicknamed \"crack\" during the series because everyone got a bit addicted due to the lack of any other sweet stuff.\nVenison became an ancient form of jerky and - by reducing the fat and adding it to berries - a greasy form of Kendall mint cake. Yum.\nYou might also see a lot of fishing in the show as well as a bit of duck hunting.\nThe crew told Newsbeat ducks would not have been in that part of the world in the Stone Age - but that they couldn't stop the cast hunting what was available.\nHere's Ray again, this time explaining foraging and how to pick the right food.\nWe use his survival buddy Bear Grylls but his menu isn't exactly for the faint-hearted.\nAlso he's been busy teaching the likes of Max from The Wanted and Jamelia how to survive in his new show Mission Survive.\n10,000 BC starts at 10pm on Channel 5 on Monday 2 February and Tuesday 3 February, with two episodes each week.\nA spin-off show focussing on the younger members of the group will also be shown on MTV during the series.\nFollow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube\nSummary:\nThe passage is about a new reality show on Channel 5, 10,000 BC, which aims to show how people lived in the Stone Age.\nThe contestants were left to fend for themselves in the countryside of Bulgaria, and had to make their own tools and food.\nThe"
