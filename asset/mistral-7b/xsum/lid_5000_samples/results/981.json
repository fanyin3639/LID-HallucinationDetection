How do I know what stock they have until I have seen it?\" - John, Derby\n'Going shopping is a nightmare for me'\n\"Everyone deserves to be able to go Christmas shopping or enjoy a festive meal or drink with their friends or colleagues,\" said Minister for Disabled People Mark Harper, who commissioned the survey.\n\"This isn't just about doing what's right. Businesses are missing a trick by not doing more to tap into this market.\n\"A fifth of the British population has a disability and they and their households have a spending power of over \u00a3200bn. Improving accessibility is a no-brainer.\"\nShadow minister for disabled people Kate Green said the report made for \"depressing\" reading.\n\"While businesses work hard to ensure their premises are accessible, some high street names are failing to make the reasonable adjustments they're required to do by law,\" she said.\n\"While it's welcome the Department for Work and Pensions have commissioned this report, this Tory-led government has weakened the Equality and Human Rights Commission that helps enforce disability discrimination law.\n\"Ministers must say what they are going to do to ensure business meets its obligations to disabled people, especially what help they will give small local businesses.\"\nBarry Stevenson, chairman of DisabledGo and a former director of Marks and Spencer, said: \"We are pleased that many retailers have invested significantly in improved accessibility in the last 10 years, but the majority are still not doing enough.\"\n\"It's entirely unacceptable for disabled people, their family, friends and carers, not to be able to access all high street shops and facilities.\"\n\"Disabled people are not asking the earth; just that management do what's reasonable and think more about how they can help disabled customers better.\n\"And that includes better communication about their accessibility online.\n\"It doesn't need to cost a fortune to do the right thing and it could be the deciding factor for disabled customers between you and a competitor.\"\nThe Equality Act of 2010 obliges organisations to make reasonable adjustments for disabled people.\nMinisters previously put a value of \u00a380bn on the spending power of people with disabilities. But this was re-calculated earlier this year to include friends and family of disabled people, not just disabled people themselves, resulting in the larger figure.\nSummary:\nThe government has commissioned a survey to assess the accessibility of venues in Britain.\nThe survey found that a fifth of shops had no wheelchair access, only 15% of restaurants and shops had hearing loops and three quarters of restaurants did not cater for those with visual impairments.\nThe government has"
