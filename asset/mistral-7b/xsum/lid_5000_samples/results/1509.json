They were served tuna ceviche and lamb in tamarind mole as President Obama used the occasion to garner support for the Dream Act, a bill to grant legal status to undocumented young people.\nMeanwhile in Mexico City, the day is likely to pass off like any other Saturday.

But the Indians, supporting a vastly outnumbered Mexican army, came out to fight from all over Puebla.\n\"They were very poor, simple people and they fought with their souls. You can imagine the political importance the United States made of the victory.

It is a story which has been celebrated by successive Mexican governments for a century and a half.\nOn Saturday, thousands of modern-day soldiers will take time away from military matters in Mexico to recreate the battle in front of President Felipe Calderon.\nBack in the US, there are still a lot of misconceptions about the Cinco de Mayo, says Mexican-born Chicago resident, Vincent Rangel.\n\"Most people think it's Mexican Independence Day,\" he chuckles.
