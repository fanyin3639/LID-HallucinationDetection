It's almost total destruction,\" Abu Ahmed tells me.  \"The Egyptians demolished my tunnel and filled it with water.\"\nRecently Egypt's military has brought in bulldozers to clear a house and olive grove concealing tunnel entrances on its side of the border.

It was an important lifeline for the 1.7m Palestinians living in Gaza who relied on the imports of everyday goods and cheap Egyptian fuel.\nHowever, the underground passages have also been used to transfer weapons, and by armed militants to cross the border unseen.  The Egyptian authorities see them as a serious threat to security.\nAttacks by Islamist militants in the Sinai region, which neighbours Gaza, have increased dramatically in the past three months, since the ousting of Egypt's Islamist President, Mohammed Morsi.\nThe new Cairo government accuses Hamas, which has ideological links to Mr Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood movement, of supporting the extremists.  It denies doing so.\nYet local media reports suggest that the Egyptian army has even threatened a military intervention in the Gaza Strip if attacks on its troops in the Sinai Peninsula are not stopped.\nAs tensions have risen, numbers of Palestinians being allowed to cross through the Rafah border crossing have been restricted.
