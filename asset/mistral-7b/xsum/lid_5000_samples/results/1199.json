As their name suggests, the scanner captures a 3D image.\nAnya sits as still as can be expected of someone who seems to be full of beans on a permanent basis.\nOn a computer screen there slowly builds an image of her left - normal - ear.\nSoftware then flips it to create a 3D mirror image: a matching replacement for the other side of her head.\nThe data is sent more than 15 miles to a 3D printer at St John's Hospital in Livingston.\nIt makes a hard copy of the image - a plastic model for a plastic surgeon.\nSuitably sterilised, it will go into the operating theatre as a guide to how the new ear should be carved out of Anya's rib cartilage.\nThe 3D scanner has been paid for by the charity The Edinburgh Sick Kids Friends Foundation.  Ken Stewart says it has transformed his team's work.\n\"We're able to get more sophisticated carving, we're more able accurately to replicate the details of the opposite ear,\" he says.\n\"And by having that template on the table it's like having an artist's model right in front of you.\"\nDr Stewart thinks the new technique could be taken much further:\n\"We're also doing some work with the Centre for Regenerative Medicine at Edinburgh University.\n\"Ultimately we want to 3D print the ear that we want as a matrix and combine that with a mixture of stem cells and cartilage cells to grow an ear in a lab and implant that.\"\nAnya appears to have become an expert on the procedures she's about to undergo.
