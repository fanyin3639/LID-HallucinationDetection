I really tried hard not to take my foot off the gas and stay focused on what I wanted to achieve.\"\nThe first six games went with serve as Parmentier's big serve kept her in touch, but when Konta converted her third break point for a 4-3 lead it sparked a brilliant burst of form from the Briton.\nKonta dropped just five points in the second set, and only seven points on serve in the entire match, as she powered through.\nShe is now one win from at least matching last year's run to the quarter-finals, where she lost to Victoria Azarenka.\nWorld number one Angelique Kerber came back from a break down in each set to beat American Shelby Rogers 6-4 7-5.\nThe German will next play Japanese qualifier Risa Ozaki, after the world number 87 saw off Kerber's compatriot Julia Goerges 7-6 (7-5) 6-3.\nWorld number 31 Kohlschreiber was superb as he took his first set against Spaniard Nadal to love in just 21 minutes.\nIt was the first time Nadal had failed to win a game in the first set of an ATP Tour match since 2008 but the 30-year-old produced a typically gutsy comeback to claim his 822nd career victory.\nHe becomes the 11th player to compete in 1,000 Tour matches - a group led by American Jimmy Connors (1,535).\n\"One thousand matches is a lot of matches. Obviously that's good news because that says I am having a long career,\" said 14-time Grand Slam champion Nadal.\n\"During a lot of years, I heard that I'm going to have a short career, so it's something important for me.

I really tried hard not to take my foot off the gas and stay focused on what I wanted to achieve.\"\nThe first six games went with serve as Parmentier's big serve kept her in touch, but when Konta converted her third break point for a 4-3 lead it sparked a brilliant burst of form from the Briton.\nKonta dropped just five points in the second set, and only seven points on serve in the entire match, as she powered through.\nShe is now one win from at least matching last year's run to the quarter-finals, where she lost to Victoria Azarenka.\nWorld number one Angelique Kerber came back from a break down in each set to beat American Shelby Rogers 6-4 7-5.\nThe German will next play Japanese qualifier Risa Ozaki, after the world number 87 saw off Kerber's compatriot Julia Goerges 7-6 (7-5) 6-3.\nWorld number 31 Kohlschreiber was superb as he took his first set against Spaniard Nadal to love in just 21 minutes.\nIt was the first time Nadal had failed to win a game in the first set of an ATP Tour match since 2008 but the 30-year-old produced a typically gutsy comeback to claim his 822nd career victory.\nHe becomes the 11th player to compete in 1,000 Tour matches - a group led by American Jimmy Connors (1,535).\n\"One thousand matches is a lot of matches. Obviously that's good news because that says I am having a long career,\" said 14-time Grand Slam champion Nadal.\n\"During a lot of years, I heard that I'm going to have a short career, so it's something important for me.
