We don't want war. But we want sincere negotiations,\" he announced.\nThen the general went further.\nFor a long time the rebels have been muttering about the possibility of partitioning CAR along religious lines - dividing it into two independent countries as was done recently in neighbouring Sudan, with Muslims taking over the north-east, and Christians getting Bangui and the south-west.\nIt has never been clear the extent to which this is a serious suggestion, or merely a bargaining ploy. Or a bit of both.\nIt seems monumentally unpractical on many levels, and given the current mess in South Sudan, the international community is unlikely to back another break-up.\nBut tens of thousands of Muslims have been forced out of their homes, with many fleeing into Cameroon or Chad, and in Bambari most Muslims I spoke to felt partition was the right policy.\nGen Zoundeiko was adamant.\n\"This state - this nation - is finished,\" he told me.\nThe words hung in the air.

We don't want war. But we want sincere negotiations,\" he announced.\nThen the general went further.\nFor a long time the rebels have been muttering about the possibility of partitioning CAR along religious lines - dividing it into two independent countries as was done recently in neighbouring Sudan, with Muslims taking over the north-east, and Christians getting Bangui and the south-west.\nIt has never been clear the extent to which this is a serious suggestion, or merely a bargaining ploy. Or a bit of both.\nIt seems monumentally unpractical on many levels, and given the current mess in South Sudan, the international community is unlikely to back another break-up.\nBut tens of thousands of Muslims have been forced out of their homes, with many fleeing into Cameroon or Chad, and in Bambari most Muslims I spoke to felt partition was the right policy.\nGen Zoundeiko was adamant.\n\"This state - this nation - is finished,\" he told me.\nThe words hung in the air. I suggested it was a pity that Muslims and Christians could not be reconciled and share one country.\n\"Yes.
