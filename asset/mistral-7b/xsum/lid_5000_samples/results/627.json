Six months into his tour of Afghanistan a female soldier accused him of sexual harassment and Johnson was later sent home",
        "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nThe 25-year-old was a private who did a nine-month tour of duty from November 2013 after serving in the Army Reserve for six years, the US military said.\nSix months into his tour of Afghanistan a female soldier accused him of sexual harassment and Johnson was later sent home, a military lawyer who represented him said.\nJohnson acted alone in the Dallas attack and had no known criminal history or ties to terrorist groups, authorities said.\nHe lived with his mother in the quiet Dallas suburb of Mesquite.\nThe BBC's Laura Bicker in Mesquite says the area is characterised by nice houses and well-kept gardens and neighbours say they are shocked that someone from there could kill police officers.\nHis sister wrote of her shock on Facebook, saying: \"I keep saying it's not true \u2026 My eyes hurt from crying,\" in a post that she later deleted.\n\"The news will say what they think, but those that knew him know this wasn't like him. This is the biggest loss we've had,\" she wrote later.\nStep-by-step guide to Dallas shootings\nHow will Dallas change Black Lives Matter?\nJohnson belonged to an informal gun club and took frequent target practice, the Los Angeles Times newspaper reported, quoting an unnamed law enforcement source.\nIn pictures: Dallas shootings\nWhat we know\nHis military occupational specialty was carpentry and masonry, the army said, and he had been awarded medals including the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with campaign star, an Army Achievement Medal, an Army Service Ribbon and an Armed Forces Reserve Medal with \"M\" Device, among other standard awards for service.\nBut lawyer Bradford Glendening said Johnson was sent home after the sexual harassment accusation, with the army recommending an \"other than honourable discharge\".\nJohnson was ordered to avoid all contact with the accuser.\nMr Glendening said Johnson was to have been removed from the army in September 2014 but for unknown reasons was instead given an honourable discharge in April 2015.\nJohnson's Facebook profile photograph showed him giving a raised fist \"black power\" salute associated with the Black Panther Party movement, a radical political organisation that emerged during the 1960s in response to police brutality in California.\nThe Black Panthers carried out armed citizens' patrols to monitor police behaviour.\nThe hunt for the wrong man\nCan white and black Americans live together?\nJohnson had joined Facebook groups that referenced the Black Panther Party, the LA Times reported, including one called the Huey P. Newton Gun Club, named after one of the Black Panthers' founders.\nThe group was created in Dallas last year to oppose police brutality, teaches self-defence and conducts patrols in areas where black men have been killed by the police.\nHowever, one of the group's members told the newspaper they did not know Johnson and had nothing to do with him.\nJohnson's Facebook profile also had photographs of the Pan-African or Black Liberation flag made up of red black and green stripes, an image depicting a black power salute and a photograph of him with Professor Griff, a former member of the US rap group Public Enemy.\nJohnson was killed when police used explosives placed by a robot to end a tense stand-off in a building where he was holed up.\nSummary:\nThe 25-year-old was a private who did a nine-month tour of duty from November 2013 after serving in the Army Reserve for six years, the US military said.\nSix months into his tour of Afghanistan a female soldier accused him of sexual harassment and Johnson was later"
