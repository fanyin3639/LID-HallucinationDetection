About half of all transactions take place in Africa, with many in Mozambique and Ethiopia.\nIn the Indian state of Gujarat, some 50,000 hectares have been acquired near Ahmedabad by the government for development as a special economic zone.

The team said there was no clear bias towards biofuel crops.\nBut apart from direct investment, the new database suggests there are some worrying trends emerging.\n\"What we are seeing is the development of other instruments that allow investors to be more invisible, such as contract farming or through bank control,\" said Dr Answeeuw.\n\"Instead of buying land through a foreign entity, they are buying stakes in local agribusiness that are controlling these lands.\"\nWhile the researchers say that economic failures especially in Africa have made investors more cautious about where they put their money, the inflow of funds is still posing some significant challenges for indigenous peoples.\n\"In many cases, it is common land or community land that is under threat,\" said Michael Taylor from the International Land Coalition.\n\"If it is grazing land or land that local people use, they don't have any legal protection.
