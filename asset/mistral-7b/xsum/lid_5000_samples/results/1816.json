A clever pick up and offload by Darren Sweetnam saw full-back Conway cross the line.\nBoth teams pursued an attacking and expansive brand of rugby. The Blues turned down a very kickable penalty for out-half Gareth Anscombe in favour of a kick into the corner.\nJames got his second try of the game following a scintillating line break by Rey Lee-Lo. The Samoan found the international winger on his inside shoulder as the Blues secured a 17-10 half-time lead.\nThe introduction of Ireland internationals CJ Stander and Donnacha Ryan early in the second half gave the home team renewed impetus. The forwards' pressure was rewarded with a try in the 62nd minute when Kilcoyne barrelled over after 12 phases on the Bues' try-line.\nDanny Wilson was also able to call on some experienced heads on the bench. Wales captain Sam Warburton made his first appearance and played his part in what was an end-to-end encounter.\nBlues regained the lead with their first meaningful attack of the half. Fish scored the try after terrific work by Lee-Lo and replacements Matthew Morgan and Lloyd Williams.\nIn the next round of Pro12 fixtures Cardiff will host Glasgow at Arms Park while Munster are away to Newport Gwent Dragons.\nMunster: Conway, Sweetnam, Goggin, R.

The Blues turned down a very kickable penalty for out-half Gareth Anscombe in favour of a kick into the corner.\nJames got his second try of the game following a scintillating line break by Rey Lee-Lo. The Samoan found the international winger on his inside shoulder as the Blues secured a 17-10 half-time lead.\nThe introduction of Ireland internationals CJ Stander and Donnacha Ryan early in the second half gave the home team renewed impetus. The forwards' pressure was rewarded with a try in the 62nd minute when Kilcoyne barrelled over after 12 phases on the Bues' try-line.\nDanny Wilson was also able to call on some experienced heads on the bench. Wales captain Sam Warburton made his first appearance and played his part in what was an end-to-end encounter.\nBlues regained the lead with their first meaningful attack of the half. Fish scored the try after terrific work by Lee-Lo and replacements Matthew Morgan and Lloyd Williams.\nIn the next round of Pro12 fixtures Cardiff will host Glasgow at Arms Park while Munster are away to Newport Gwent Dragons.\nMunster: Conway, Sweetnam, Goggin, R.
