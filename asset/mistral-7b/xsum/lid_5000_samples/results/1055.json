However, some cancerous cells can have more than 100 chromosomes.\nAnd the pattern is inconsistent - pick a bunch of neighbouring cells and they could each have different chromosome counts.\nThis diversity helps tumours adapt to become untreatable and colonise new parts of the body. Devising ways of preventing a cancer from becoming diverse is a growing field of research.\nScientists at the Cancer Research UK London Research Institute and the University College London Cancer Institute have been trying to crack how cancers become so diverse in the first place.\nIt had been thought that when a cancer cell split to create two new cells, the chromosomes were not split evenly between the two.\nHowever, lead researcher Prof Charles Swanton's tests on bowel cancer showed \"very little evidence\" that was the case.\nInstead the study showed the problem came from making copies of the cancer's genetic code.\nCancers are driven to make copies of themselves, however, if cancerous cells run out of the building blocks of their DNA they develop \"DNA replication stress\".\nThe study showed the stress led to errors and tumour diversity.\nProf Swanton told the BBC: \"It is like constructing a building without enough bricks or cement for the foundations.\n\"However, if you can provide the building blocks of DNA you can reduce the replication stress to limit the diversity in tumours, which could be therapeutic.\"\nHe admitted that it \"just seems wrong\" that providing the fuel for a cancer to grow could be therapeutic.\nHowever, he said this proved that replication stress was the problem and that new tools could be developed to tackle it.\nFuture studies will investigate whether the same stress causes diversity in other types of tumour.\nThe research team identified three genes often lost in diverse bowel cancer cells, which were critical for the cancer suffering from DNA replication stress.
