But it did not hurt.\"\nBy Lars BevangerOslo\nAnders Breivik has been confronted with the first of those he shot and wounded but who survived at Utoeya.\nOne very slight, and in her own words very nervous, young girl asked to have him removed from court before she took to the witness stand.\nFrida Holm Skoglund felt she could not give testimony while the man who tried to kill her less than a year ago sat only a few metres away.\nHer small voice and slight build was an enormous contrast to her story of survival. She told the court how she had managed to remove the bullet from her wound herself before taking to the icy waters and swimming until an asthma attack almost made her go underwater.\nSpeaking in court today, she had one message for the killer: \"We won, he lost. Norwegian youths can swim.\"\nAsked about Breivik's demeanour during his shooting spree, she said he seemed calm, but \"aggressive on the trigger\".\nShe then told how she and several friends went into the water and swam for their lives. She said she had been the leader of a group from her part of Norway and the three youngest had all been killed.\nDespite her loss, when asked whether she had a short message for their killer, Ms Skoglund said: \"We won, he lost!\"\nMonday's fourth witness, Ane Kollen Evenmo, 17, said she was trying to flee in a boat with several others when she saw Breivik, wearing a police uniform, on the shore of Utoeya.\nThinking Breivik was a police officer, she waved to him for help, but realised her mistake when he began shooting at the boat, she said.\nBreivik claims to have been defending Norway from immigration and says he attacked the Labour Party youth event on the island of Utoeya because of the party's support for multiculturalism.\nLast week, the court heard from survivors who escaped unhurt, as well as the last of evidence from coroners who carried out post mortem examinations on Breivik's victims.\nThe trial's outcome hinges on whether the court finds Breivik to have been sane.
