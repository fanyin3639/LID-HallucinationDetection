I even got engaged,\" he said. \"I thought I had to live a certain way.\n\"I thought I needed to marry a woman and raise kids with her. I kept telling myself the sky was red, but I always knew it was blue.\"\nCollins said he decided he should go public after his former roommate at Stanford University, Congressman Joe Kennedy, scion of the Kennedy political dynasty, marched in a Boston gay pride parade.\nAs basketball player at Stanford, Collins competed in the national collegiate championship tournament, reaching the fourth round.
