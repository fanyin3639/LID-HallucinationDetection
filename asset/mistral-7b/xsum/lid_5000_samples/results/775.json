It did because Hamilton had a very clear focus on getting pole and winning at the last four races of the season, and he delivered.\nAt the same time, Rosberg's focus was on the championship and he could be risk-averse. He knew he just needed to pick up the points to win the title, so his mentality and game plan changed.\nThe second issue at play was that this was Rosberg's best chance of winning a world title.\nPartly because, as Vettel said, you never know what's just around the corner and it was the first time he had gone into a title decider ahead. And given his and Hamilton's relative performances over their careers, that has to be considered unlikely to happen again.\nBrazil was Rosberg's risk race - with the rain and the Red Bull performance there. And he got through that.\nBut he had been on pole in Abu Dhabi for the last two years, he won there in 2015, the weather is predictable, Mercedes were always going to dominate.\nIt was illuminating to see the difference in vision after the race between the three main bosses of the Mercedes team - Toto Wolff, Paddy Lowe and Niki Lauda.\nLauda, the ex-racing driver, said: No problems, that's what it was. The commercial person, Wolff, and the engineer, Lowe - the two people who think strategically - were not happy because it did not fit the criteria they had laid out.\nBut Hamilton and Rosberg were hired to be ruthless, to win races and world titles. Not because they were nice guys. They were hired to do what they had to do to win.\nIf you put a tiger in a cage and the keeper goes in, you can't expect the tiger not to bite at some point.\nRacing drivers are very emotionally driven. They are aggressive, determined and focused, and in situations like that they have two hours to determine whether they are world champion\u2026 or not.\nIf the situation had been reversed, I'm sure Rosberg would have done the same thing.\nThis issue of the boundaries of acceptable competition between two drivers in the same team has already come up twice this year - in Spain and Austria.\nWhen a crash took them both out in Barcelona, you could argue Hamilton stuck his nose into a decreasing gap, or that Rosberg closed the door, depending on your point of view.\nIn Austria, you could do the same, but it was more clear-cut - Rosberg was a bit clumsy in his defence on the last lap, and he was penalised for it by the stewards.\nAfter neither of those incidents was a driver suspended, so it is hard to see how that could happen now. It feels like hot air.\nYes, Mercedes warned them after Austria that they faced a ban if they collided again.

He drove slowly all race, but he could have backed him up much more aggressively than he did, rather than gradually letting him go.\nI don't think Hamilton was deliberately trying to crash.
