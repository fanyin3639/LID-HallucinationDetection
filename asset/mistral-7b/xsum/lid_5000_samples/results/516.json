In 2013/14 that figure had risen to 4,997 and now accounts for nearly half of all new cases.\nNewsbeat gained exclusive access to Marijuana Anonymous (MA), a group which helps addicts.\nWe met one 25-year-old, \"John\", who explained how addiction took over his life.\n\"I would sit willing myself not to smoke even as I rolled a joint. My brain said no but my hands kept rolling and smoking.\n\"The drug wasn't making me happy, the weed was the cause and I couldn't stop. I couldn't stop.\n\"I have a hole inside me that I tried to fill. Weed fit the hole.\n\"It was the perfect match, it filled all the gaps and that's why I went back to it. Now I fill that with MA.\"\nDr Winstock told Newsbeat that 50% to 60% of dependent users have serious withdrawal symptoms when they come off the substance.\n\"Some people become violent, some young people can't sleep and get very irritable\".\nMany claim that cannabis is different to other drugs and isn't physically addictive like heroin or cocaine.\nDr Winstock told us that argument misses the point.\n\"I think people get confused with physical withdrawal symptoms and equating those to being addicted.\n\"Addiction for me is a loss of control and when you stop you feel uncomfortable.\n\"[It] could be you feel miserable, you can't sleep, you lose your appetite or it can be very physical as it is with heroin or alcohol\".\nHe said the younger the user the more likely they are to have problems in the future.\n\"About 10% of people who use cannabis are dependent and two-thirds of those people, when they stop, will experience withdrawal symptoms.\n\"They last seven to 10 days for most people. You are more likely to run into those problems if you start using early.\"\n23-year-old Lee got help from MA but before that he says his life was a blur of \"joint after joint\".\n\"Cannabis was my drug of no choice,\" he said.\n\"I found myself smoking even though I didn't want to be doing it. Physically it drained me, it made me very unhealthy. I was a broken man.\n\"I wasn't eating and I was just over five-and-a-half stone. Eating got in the way of my smoking.\n\"And I would go a week without having a bath or shower.\n\"I would smoke before work, during work, after work, I would lie to people just so I could be on my own smoking.\"\nCases like Lee's make up most of the workload for drug workers like Phoebe Crowder from the charity Addaction, who works with young addicts in east London.\nShe told Newsbeat: \"I have some young people saying 'I want to stop, but I am going to hang out with my friends.
