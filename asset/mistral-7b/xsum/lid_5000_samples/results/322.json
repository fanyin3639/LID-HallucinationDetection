A front-of-pack colour coding and nutritional information system is currently being used.\nIt is not clear how this will be done, as introducing food labelling has proved difficult because of industry opposition and the need for mandatory rules to be agreed at an EU level.\nMeanwhile, the pledge of plain packaging comes after the government has carried out a consultation on the issue and said it is \"minded\" to introduce it, but has yet to confirm it will.\nTargeted action on high-strength, cheap alcohol is also needed, Mr Burnham will say, with options on pricing and bottle size being explored.\n\"Labour has traditionally led the way on public health and this new approach will chart a new course towards a healthy nation in the 21st century.\n\"Children need better protection from the pressures of modern living and the harm caused by alcohol, sugar and smoke. and Labour will not flinch from taking the action needed to provide it.\"\nProfessor John Ashton, president of the Faculty of Public Health, said the steps proposed were in line with the organisation's \"public health priorities\".\n\"We need an honest discussion about whether we can still have a world-class health system without government intervening, where only it can, to improve and protect our health.\"\nA Conservative spokesman said: \"Labour are naive to think that just banning particular types of food will support people to make informed choices.
