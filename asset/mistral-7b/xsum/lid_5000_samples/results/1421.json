        "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nGhostly pale and totally blind, olms - fondly known by locals as \"baby dragons\" - only reproduce every 5-10 years and are thought to live to 100.\nThis clutch of eggs started to appear in January in an aquarium in Postojna Cave, a tourist destination where the creatures have lived for millennia.\nObserving baby olms develop and hatch is a rare opportunity for science.\nThe first of 23 developed eggs hatched on 30 May; a second baby olm (pictured below) was slowly wriggling out of its egg on Wednesday night.\n\"It is the end of one part of the story and the beginning of a whole new chapter: feeding and living without the egg,\" said Saso Weldt, who looks after and studies the olms at Postojna Cave.\nHe told BBC News nobody witnessed the first egg hatching, but the moment was captured thanks to an infrared camera.\n\"I was in the cave doing some other biological work. Since we have all the eggs on an IR camera, we saw that one was missing.
