It was all about defining ourselves and refusing to be stripped of our humanity.\nAngelique Kidjo was speaking to the BBC's Newshour programme\nAfrica has lost another worthy son in the shape of Papa Wemba. It's a painful beginning to 2016.\nHe was the voice of Africa.\nWe are all orphans... May the heaven and the spirits welcome him in peace. Papa Wemba will remain forever in our hearts.\nManu Dibango left this message on his Facebook page.\nIt's a catastrophe. Congolese music has been decimated, it's been blown apart. I don't know what to say.\nI refused to believe it when the Ivory Coast government official told me. To be honest, from now on, life means nothing, we are nothing.\nToday, with God's forgiveness, I want to ask Him to accept Papa Wemba. He is His son.\nI don't know what to say. I want to give my condolences to all Congolese people and all Africans.\nThis is an extract from a video Koffi Olomide posted on his Facebook page.\nI was quite shocked because we were just getting over Prince's death and then hearing this it was sad.\nHe was performing in a period of people like my father Fela Kuti, Miriam Makeba, Hugh Masakela, Manu Dibango - the African greats who have always opened doors for people like me.\nThey have always done Africa proud anywhere in Europe and America where they performed, and they opened doors for African musicians to tour Europe with great pride and respect.\nEspecially when you are playing African music in Europe and America, Papa Wemba's name will be in the forefront of great names.\nIt's a name that was always there and will always be there. It's not a name that will go away any time soon.\nFemi Kuti was speaking to the BBC 's Focus on Africa radio programme.\nIt was such a shock when I received the news it was something I didn't see coming.\nHe was one of the people whose stars shone so brightly.

It was all about defining ourselves and refusing to be stripped of our humanity.\nAngelique Kidjo was speaking to the BBC's Newshour programme\nAfrica has lost another worthy son in the shape of Papa Wemba. It's a painful beginning to 2016.\nHe was the voice of Africa.\nWe are all orphans... May the heaven and the spirits welcome him in peace. Papa Wemba will remain forever in our hearts.\nManu Dibango left this message on his Facebook page.\nIt's a catastrophe. Congolese music has been decimated, it's been blown apart. I don't know what to say.\nI refused to believe it when the Ivory Coast government official told me. To be honest, from now on, life means nothing, we are nothing.\nToday, with God's forgiveness, I want to ask Him to accept Papa Wemba. He is His son.\nI don't know what to say. I want to give my condolences to all Congolese people and all Africans.\nThis is an extract from a video Koffi Olomide posted on his Facebook page.\nI was quite shocked because we were just getting over Prince's death and then hearing this it was sad.\nHe was performing in a period of people like my father Fela Kuti, Miriam Makeba, Hugh Masakela, Manu Dibango - the African greats who have always opened doors for people like me.\nThey have always done Africa proud anywhere in Europe and America where they performed, and they opened doors for African musicians to tour Europe with great pride and respect.\nEspecially when you are playing African music in Europe and America, Papa Wemba's name will be in the forefront of great names.\nIt's a name that was always there and will always be there. It's not a name that will go away any time soon.\nFemi Kuti was speaking to the BBC 's Focus on Africa radio programme.\nIt was such a shock when I received the news it was something I didn't see coming.\nHe was one of the people whose stars shone so brightly.
