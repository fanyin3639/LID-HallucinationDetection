They are up against it. Facing France in France is not easy.\nBut if they perform as they did against us, they will deserve the Grand Slam.\nThey deserve credit for the way they have played and not many teams expected what they have produced.\nOur disappointing 20-13 loss to England last Saturday was still an excellent game - you did not know which way it would swing.\nAnd while we have got to be disappointed with our first-half performance, we can be really proud of the positives in the second half.\nIt shows how we are developing as a squad because, two years ago, if we had gone in at half-time, we might not have come back at all.\nEvery time England turned us over, they put us in the corner, the momentum completely swung.\nKeeping the ball has to be a key thing in our game in future. But we can do it. It is about consistency.\nAnd we know from the fact that we lost away to Italy last year and they are building each year, they will punish us on Sunday if they can.\nBut we have won all our home games so far this year and we need to go out and perform.\nIt is a huge chance for us to finish the campaign on a high.\nBefore the start of this championship, we wanted at least two wins, to guarantee World Cup qualification, so I think the pressure is off a bit in the sense that we have now qualified.\nBut finishing with a 100% home record would go someway towards people starting to fear playing Wales away from home.\nThroughout the next year, core skills will be a massive focus for us so, come the 2017 World Cup, we are as sharp as possible.\nAnd the rugby sevens is going to do wonders for the profile of the women's game this summer.\nWith the European Championships and then the Olympics in Rio, attention will remain on women's rugby and Welsh women's rugby.\nAfter Rio, people are going to say: \"I want to play rugby.\"\nWales have two sevens-format stars to look out for too, who are possibly heading for Rio with Team GB.\nLaurie Harries and Jasmine Joyce both had a really good run at the World Series qualifiers.\nAustralia and New Zealand usually dominate the Sevens Series and will be contenders in Brazil.\nBut France are also among the European teams with a good chance if they perform well.\nOne loss can cause a big upset - that is all part of the excitement of sevens.\nSian Williams was talking to BBC Wales Sport's Tom Garry.\nIf you've been inspired by Sian to try rugby you can find out how to get involved here.\nSummary:\nWomen's rugby is growing on the performance side, but I also think the style of rugby is now the most exciting to watch.\nThe level of interest has been helped by the fact that more matches are being televised.\nAt the start of the tournament, people would have expected holders Ireland or France",

Facing France in France is not easy.\nBut if they perform as they did against us, they will deserve the Grand Slam.\nThey deserve credit for the way they have played and not many teams expected what they have produced.\nOur disappointing 20-13 loss to England last Saturday was still an excellent game - you did not know which way it would swing.\nAnd while we have got to be disappointed with our first-half performance, we can be really proud of the positives in the second half.\nIt shows how we are developing as a squad because, two years ago, if we had gone in at half-time, we might not have come back at all.\nEvery time England turned us over, they put us in the corner, the momentum completely swung.\nKeeping the ball has to be a key thing in our game in future. But we can do it. It is about consistency.\nAnd we know from the fact that we lost away to Italy last year and they are building each year, they will punish us on Sunday if they can.\nBut we have won all our home games so far this year and we need to go out and perform.\nIt is a huge chance for us to finish the campaign on a high.\nBefore the start of this championship, we wanted at least two wins, to guarantee World Cup qualification, so I think the pressure is off a bit in the sense that we have now qualified.\nBut finishing with a 100% home record would go someway towards people starting to fear playing Wales away from home.\nThroughout the next year, core skills will be a massive focus for us so, come the 2017 World Cup, we are as sharp as possible.\nAnd the rugby sevens is going to do wonders for the profile of the women's game this summer.\nWith the European Championships and then the Olympics in Rio, attention will remain on women's rugby and Welsh women's rugby.\nAfter Rio, people are going to say: \"I want to play rugby.\"\nWales have two sevens-format stars to look out for too, who are possibly heading for Rio with Team GB.\nLaurie Harries and Jasmine Joyce both had a really good run at the World Series qualifiers.\nAustralia and New Zealand usually dominate the Sevens Series and will be contenders in Brazil.\nBut France are also among the European teams with a good chance if they perform well.\nOne loss can cause a big upset - that is all part of the excitement of sevens.\nSian Williams was talking to BBC Wales Sport's Tom Garry.\nIf you've been inspired by Sian to try rugby you can find out how to get involved here.\nSummary:\nWomen's rugby is growing on the performance side, but I also think the style of rugby is now the most exciting to watch.\nThe level of interest has been helped by the fact that more matches are being televised.\nAt the start of the tournament, people would have expected holders Ireland or France"
