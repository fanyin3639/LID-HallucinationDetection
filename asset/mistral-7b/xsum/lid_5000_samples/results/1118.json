Staff are required to divest themselves of potential conflicts of interest when they enter office.\nHere are five key points found in the documents.\nThis should not come as too big a shock.\nThe documents show President Trump's daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, have assets valued between $240m and $740m (\u00c2\u00a3191m- \u00c2\u00a3590m).\nThat includes a stake in Trump International Hotel, which earned Ms Trump between $1m and $5m last year.\nThe financial disclosure was made when Mr Kushner was appointed as a senior adviser to Mr Trump - it also details his wife's finances. She has since been appointed to the White House staff, so will have to fill in her own disclosure forms.\nMr Kushner's previous interests, which he has now divested, make for a long read. The documents show that Mr Kushner had stakes in Rupert Murdoch's News Corp and 21st Century Fox businesses - the pro-Trump channel Fox News is owned by the latter.\nOne person named in the disclosure no longer works at the White House - Boris Epshteyn, who worked in the press office and regularly appeared on TV during Mr Trump's campaign to defend him.\nBorn in Russia and a naturalised US citizen, Mr Epshteyn left his role last week for reasons not yet divulged.\nThe documents show he owned stakes in two restaurants - Quality Italian in New York City (\"a modern take on the Italian-American steakhouse tradition\") and Quality Meats restaurant in Miami, one of the specialities of which is broccoli and Cheetos crisps.\nOmarosa Manigault rose to fame as a contestant on Mr Trump's reality TV show The Apprentice, and is now a senior White House communications official.\nThe documents show she received \"a wedding dress, custom veil and accessories with an estimated value of $25,000\" as part of her appearance on another reality TV show, Say Yes to the Dress.\nThe documents also show she is a beneficiary from a trust, worth between $1m-$5m, established by her late fiance, the Green Mile actor Michael Clarke Duncan, who died in 2012.\nSteve Bannon was once the head of the right-wing website Breitbart News, but is now one of Mr Trump's most important strategists.\nHe made his money in media financing (helping get the comedy show Seinfeld, among others, off the ground).\nThe White House papers show his property and other holdings could top $50m - the documents list asset values within a range, rather than giving precise figures.\nThose are not the deepest pockets in the White House though - Gary Cohn, a former president of the Goldman Sachs bank who is now head of the White House National Economic Council, detailed assets worth at least $230m.\nMr Bannon is not the only Breitbart alumni to occupy the corridors of power - among them is Julia Hahn, who is now a White House policy strategist.\nThe documents show she earned $117,217 last year for her work as a senior investigative reporter for Breitbart (as well as another $74,082 for producing a show on the right-wing Ingraham Radio network).\nThe US Department of Labor says the average salary for reporters and correspondents last year was $49,770 - less than a third of what Julia Hahn made.\nSummary:\nThe release late on Friday revealed millions of dollars in assets held by top White House aides and officials.\nNeither President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence nor cabinet appointees were part of the release.\nWhite House officials said these were \"not the current holdings that everyone has today",
