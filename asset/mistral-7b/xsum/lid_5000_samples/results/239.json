        "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nA pugnacious outlier called the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) or Common Man's Party, born out of a strong anti-corruption movement and tapping into popular disenchantment with the major political parties, has made a spectacular debut in state elections in Delhi.\nIt has picked up 28 of the 70 seats and more importantly, over 30% of the votes, routing the ruling Congress party and putting the single largest BJP party under watch.

        "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nA pugnacious outlier called the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) or Common Man's Party, born out of a strong anti-corruption movement and tapping into popular disenchantment with the major political parties, has made a spectacular debut in state elections in Delhi.\nIt has picked up 28 of the 70 seats and more importantly, over 30% of the votes, routing the ruling Congress party and putting the single largest BJP party under watch. Thanks to the AAP's bravura performance, the capital may be headed for a hung assembly and forced into a re-election. \"AAP proves,\" an analyst told me, \"the people are desperately looking for alternatives, not merely an option.\"\nEven its critics concede the Delhi result is a stunning feat for a year-old party in a country where barriers to political entry are prohibitively high.\nArvind Kejriwal, a once-taciturn civil servant-turned popular leader, has emerged as the giant killer, routing Chief Minister Sheila Dixit, a veteran Congresswoman, who was eyeing a fourth consecutive term in office. Not since the emergence of the regional Telugu Desam Party in southern Andhra Pradesh state in the 1980s has India seen such a striking political debut.\nAnalysts say the AAP has offered itself as a credible alternative to people fed up with corruption, unresponsive politicians and high inflation.\nThey believe that the party changed the political discourse of the elections. It forced the BJP to change a lacklustre chief ministerial candidate, put out separate manifestos for 70 constituencies, skilfully used social media, successfully garnered the support of the traditional media and promised to pursue \"honest, people's politics\".

The new party projected itself as \"pro-change, anti-establishment and anti-politician\", as an analyst succinctly put it.\nHowever, the AAP's emergence also points to an inflection point in India's stodgy politics dominated by identity, caste, patronage, sycophancy, dynastic impulses and opaque financing.\nWhat makes the party unique?\nFor one, unlike new parties in the past that had their origins in region and identity-based movements, AAP was not identifiable with either.\nAlso, it is the first party to emerge entirely out of urban India with its leaders mainly belonging to the middle class. \"The party,\" analyst Pratap Bhanu Mehta told me, \"is the creation of urban, middle class imagination.\"\nMoreover, AAP is the first party that has impressed with an innovative use of political techniques. It was clearly demonstrated in its poll spending model - transparent, open donations from the public - and volunteer workers who took time off from their jobs and businesses to work for the party.\nThough born out of a vigorous anti-corruption movement that captured the people's imagination, the party's identity is forged around the notions of accountability and governance, something unprecedented in India's parties.\nThe party is also forcing other parties to rethink their strategies.\n\"They showed a lot of creativity and imagination.
