        "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nAnd its capacity to divide non-indigenous Australians has again been thrust into the spotlight, this time because of a primary school play. It has also raised debate about what is appropriate for children to be taught at school.\nStudents at the government-run Forestville Public School in Sydney's north last week performed a history presentation titled Australia - You're Standing In It (named after a 1980s TV comedy show).\nWhile the play, presented by junior students, covered various Australian history topics, a segment performed for parents by Year 5 and 6 students about one of the nation's darkest chapters - the Stolen Generations - has sparked controversy.\nTens of thousands of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children were forcibly taken from their parents by government authorities between 1883 and 1969 and placed into boys' and girls' homes, foster families or Christian missions. On turning 18 they were cast out, often scarred for life, support groups say.\nThe policy's most widely cited motivations include that it was a protective move based on a belief the indigenous population would die out, that children were being neglected, or that it was a way of introducing religion to Aboriginal people.\nSome indigenous groups, however, say the main motivation was to put a swift end to Aboriginal culture.\nIn 2008, newly elected Prime Minister Kevin Rudd issued a famous, long-awaited apology in parliament to the Stolen Generations, saying he hoped Australia could turn a new page by \"righting the wrongs of the past and so moving forward with confidence to the future\".\nBut nine years on, the issue is still a thorny one.\nOne parent who saw the play at Forestville was Robbie Slater. A former Australia and English Premier League footballer whose five-year-old son attends the school, Mr Slater came out in the media to say he was \"disgusted\" by the segment.\n\"It was bloody disgraceful,\" Mr Slater, now a TV football commentator, told local newspaper The Manly Daily, adding he had walked out \"at certain stages\" during the play.\n\"I don't think using five, six or seven-year-old kids is appropriate to push your own political agenda,\" he added.\nHowever, the children presenting the Stolen Generations segment were from the nine-12 age bracket. Also, students from kindergarten to Year 4 did not watch that part of the play.\nInitial reports also said the play featured children dressed as nuns who were mentally and physically abusing students playing Stolen Generations children.\nThe issue drew more visceral reaction through Sydney right-wing radio talkback host Ray Hadley, who demanded an inquiry from the New South Wales state government, and called the teachers organising the play \"imbeciles\".\nIn his column in Sydney's Daily Telegraph, Mr Hadley railed against the \"socialist engineers masquerading as teachers who organised the left-leaning display\", saying children \"go to school for an education, not to be indoctrinated by rabid left-wingers\".\nMr Slater and Mr Hadley also highlighted the fact children in the play held up a placard reading \"Sorry\" as an example of a political agenda being forced onto them.\nThe play came in a tense week for race relations in Australia, with a local council in Melbourne drawing flak from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, among many others, for announcing it would abandon its traditional Australia Day celebrations on 26 January.\nThis was done out of respect for indigenous people, many of whom refer to the anniversary of the landing of the First Fleet in 1788 not as \"Australia Day\" but \"Invasion Day\".\nAfter the initial media flurry about the Forestville play, however, many parents from the school came out in support of the performance, saying schools should not shy away from the more troubling aspects of Australian history.\nNina Mapson Bone, who has a son in Year 3 at the school, said \"discomfort should not be a reason not to teach our children about the facts of important events in Australia's history\".\n\"The overwhelming majority of parents who saw the play did not think it was inappropriate,\" she told the BBC. \"I haven't come across any other parents who agreed with that one angry parent.\n\"The play was factual, not political.\"\nMs Mapson Bone said what her son had learned from the play was the \"compassion and understanding\" that are essential in helping fix some of the issues relating to Aboriginal reconciliation in Australia.\nShe also said two of the school's Aboriginal students had been in the play.\n\"The play was a very positive experience for them,\" she said.\n\"It was very important for them to be able to share their culture with the rest of the school.\"\nMs Mapson Bone said the play had been a learning experience",
