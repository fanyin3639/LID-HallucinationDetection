They could declare their income elsewhere, dodging that extra top rate - and depriving Scotland of all their tax contribution, not just a portion.\nSo it seems that is unlikely - even although it must be politically tempting to match Labour's top rate rhetoric.\nIn the same interview with me, she acknowledged that it would be an option to decline to apply an increase in the 40p threshold to Scotland.\nSo that looks decidedly in prospect.
