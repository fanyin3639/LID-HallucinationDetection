The ratings agencies' message is simple - get things right or suffer the consequences.\nBoth have given differing reasons, but they agree on one issue: that the South African economy is not as attractive or stable as it previously was.\nTo assess whether there is general consensus on how bad things are, the investment community will be waiting for Fitch's announcement later this month.\nIf South Africa wants to preserve its sovereign credit rating, it must take bold actions quickly.\nOtherwise the near future is one of a downgrade to \"junk\" status, which will lead to reputational damage, higher borrowing costs, disinvestment, the decline in the value of pension funds and make life more expensive for its citizens.\nSouth Africa has not been below investment grade since 1994.\nIn December, S&P revised its outlook on South Africa's rating from stable to negative, citing fears that economic growth might be lower than expected.\nLast month, the International Monetary Fund cut its 2016 forecast for South Africa to 0.6%, from 0.7%.
