A stout Italian plumber famous for his red cap and blue overalls, he has appeared in scores of video games, becoming the world's biggest selling video game franchise of all time.\nMario was not the only pop culture icon in attendance.

Can Tokyo2020 be staffed entirely by robots? Many put in requests for robot volunteers to staff the Olympics or at least the ceremonies to employ robots as performers.\nIn Japan, the interest in the ceremony was also fevered, with people apparently excited and delighted by their cosplay PM's guest appearance.\nSome even felt the need to mark the once-in-a-lifetime event with caffeine.\nOthers, however, weren't as impressed, with one commenting that the event was \"nothing compared\" to Queen Elizabeth playing a Bond girl in the London 2012 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony.\nYet Mr Abe's appearance has provided some form of positive coverage for the Tokyo Games, which has been plagued by controversy. Tokyo was accused of plagiarising its initial Olympic 2020 logo, which it eventually changed, and the original stadium design by architect Zaha Hadid was scrapped due to spiralling costs.\nBut for now, it seems many people are putting its bad publicity aside, and expecting their minds to be blown by whatever Tokyo has planned for four years' time.\nSummary:\n1. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe popped out of a giant green pipe dressed up as video game character Mario from the Super Mario games.\n2. The Tokyo2020 video beamed to audiences in Rio showed Mario running excitedly around Tokyo then jumping into his famous green pipe.\n"
