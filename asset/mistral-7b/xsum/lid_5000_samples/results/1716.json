        "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nYou know the script. Hero retires, retreats into the wilderness, grows a big beard, dons a lumberjack shirt and chops wood. He is then asked to come out of retirement for one last mission.\nIgnoring the slight embellishment, Edwin van der Sar was that hero this weekend.\nThe 45-year-old former Manchester United player dusted off those gloves one more time to turn out for Dutch amateur side VV Noordwijk, whose keeper picked up an injury. Yes, they only have one keeper!\nAnd in true Hollywood style, Van der Sar produced a slow-mo scene-stealing moment when he dived to his left to deny Jodan Boys' Jorn van Lunteren.\nHe did concede in the 1-1 draw, but we'll gloss over that.\nREAD IT: Van der Sar comes out of retirement and saves a penalty\nZlatan Ibrahimovic added yet another major honour to his collection this weekend by helping Paris St-Germain to their fourth successive league title. The Swede, who has been involved in each of those campaigns, has now won 11 league titles in five countries.\nNever one prone to self-doubt, he has suggested he would remain at the club next season if they replaced the city's Eiffel Tower with a structure built in his honour.\nNow if Arsene Wenger can just persuade Boris Johnson to re-construct Big Ben as an effigy of Zlatan, he might finally be able to land a big-name striker.\nREAD IT: Ibrahimovic likely to leave PSG\nMost of us have tipping points and this weekend we found out what awakes the raging green monster inside the usually unflappable, impassive Jordan Spieth.\nThe 22-year-old two-time major winner, who narrowly made the cut at the Valspar Championship in Florida, came out fighting when an Instagram follower labelled him as \"garbage\" and \"very average\".\nSpieth responded with, \"Couldn't be further from the truth troll. Go do research before hating.\"\nThe Texan calmed down and told ESPN: \"You'll probably never see me do that again because obviously it was seen and known and just really frustrating.\"\nREAD IT: Spieth hits back at 'garbage' comment\nHamstring, cruciate, calf, groin move aside, there's a new ailment in town - spider bites.\nStriker James Gray has only just resumed full training for Wrexham following a month out because he was recovering from a false widow spider bite. Yikes!\nThe 23-year-old had to have surgery after the critter left a gaping hole in his arm.\nGray said he has suffered no long-lasting effects, although he was last seen swinging off the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct in a red and blue spandex suit.\nREAD IT: Wrexham striker set for return after spider bite\nUnited States and rugby union.
