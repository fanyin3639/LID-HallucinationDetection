        "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nNo-one would ever think that a few months ago this 18-year-old was arrested wearing a suicide vest, hours before he was to blow himself up at Kohat University in north-west Pakistan.\nGul was at school in Kohat, a city in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. During the summer holidays, he would visit his ancestral village in a tribal area near the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan.\nIt was in that volatile territory that one of his cousins connected him to the militants and he was recruited for training.\n\"They [the militants] used to give us lectures [saying that] according to Sharia [Islamic law] it is obligatory to pursue jihad [holy war] against the government now. I lost my mind and started believing them. They lectured me for three months,\" says Gul Khan.\nHe tells me his story from a centre established by Pakistan's army in the town of Tank, close to the border with Afghanistan, for the rehabilitation of young men who supported and sympathised with militants.\nOne of three such units in Pakistan, the centre is protected by tight security. But inside there are classrooms for vocational training, a basketball court, a TV room and a mosque.\nGul Khan underwent militant training with around 12 others at a camp in the Orakzai tribal region. His parents were completely unaware of this radicalisation until his last trip to Kohat.\nThen security agencies raided his house and arrested him with a suicide jacket.\n\"They [the militants] said girls are getting education in the university and that is against the teachings of Islam.  If girls study, they will become empowered and destroy our religious centres, so I thought if I blew up the university I would go to Jannah [paradise].\"\nSuicide bombers have proven to be the deadliest weapon used by the Pakistani Taliban against civilians and the country's security forces. Pakistan has seen about 350 such attacks since 2002.\nAlong with Gul Khan, there are 31 other young men  on the army-run programme. They were recruited in the name of religion - and jihad - from outside schools, mosques and colleges, persuaded by Taliban arguments about US interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq and drone attacks on the borders of their own country.\nThey were later arrested across different parts of north-west Pakistan.\nMubarak Ali had thrown grenades at a police van. He said he had been recruited by a mysterious man lingering outside his college.\n\"He had long hair, and he used to play religious songs on his mobile phone loudly. Every day I used to see him at my college gate talking to boys, making friendships with them. I also became his friend.\n\"Then he started walking with me after my classes. We had long discussions about Islam and the US invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan. He changed my mind,\" says Mubarak Ali.\n\"He knew how to convince others, how to change minds, I started believing him. He used to talk about Jannah, that I would go to Jannah if I did jihad.\"\nIn the centre, would-be suicide bombers Mubarak Ali and others are getting psychiatric help. And to counter such radical ideas, the centre also has moderate clerics.\nThe cleric at the centre has daily sessions with the students, where he explains how suicide and the killing of innocents is strictly forbidden in Islam. He also has one-on-one sessions with the young men.\nGul Khan says: \"Now I thank God that I was unable to detonate my jacket. I have been told that suicide is forbidden in Islam.\"\nMilitary commander Brigadier Warriach, who runs the centre, told me: \"Security agencies uncover terror plots on routine basis, and we arrest many people.
