The staging, slow motion techniques and sound effects made the film look more like an IS production than a traditional Boko Haram video.\nAnother of the films was billed as the first in a series entitled Message from a Mujahid, which featured a militant from the group defending the group's ideology, tactics and plans. IS itself has a series of videos with the same title featuring its militants speaking to camera.\nBut despite the marked improvements in quality, Boko Haram's overall media package remains some way off the sophistication of IS' output.\nBoko Haram has also been referring to itself repeatedly as an Islamic State or \"Islamic State in West Africa\".\nHowever, this did not suggest that Boko Haram was necessarily positioning itself as part of the wider IS caliphate.\nThe group is still using its traditional Arabic name to promote its material and its branding remains distinct from that of IS.\nBoko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau declared an \"Islamic State\" in northern Nigeria in August last year and praised IS for its military advances the previous month.
