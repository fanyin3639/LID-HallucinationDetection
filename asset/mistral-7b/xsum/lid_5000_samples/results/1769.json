They claim some will be forced to close, meaning jobs will be lost.\nThe government was also worried about changing the current rules.\nBut there could still be an appeal, meaning a final decision might be years away.\nSo with lots of uncertainty around the ruling, employment lawyer Nickie Elenor answers some of the big questions...\nIf you regularly get overtime as part of your pay, you might have a claim. But it's thought the extra work will need to be so regular it's become a normal part of your salary. Exactly how regular that is is still unclear though. And if the overtime's voluntary, we still don't know if you'll benefit.\nLook at your average weekly pay over the three months before a week's leave. We think that's how much you'd be entitled to for your first four weeks holiday every tax year. If you get more than four weeks leave, you'll only receive basic pay for the rest of it, because companies don't have to give you that much time off.\nThat's a tricky one. Because this case is still going through the courts, it might take some time to become established law. Or the idea might get chucked out altogether. Until then, you could try writing to your employer to tell them that you know this is a rule that you believe is going to become law, therefore you believe they should pay and provide them with your calculation. Good Luck!\nWe've never heard of this happening, but that's not to say it doesn't happen.\nAnother tricky one. At the moment it looks like you won't be able to claim back more than three months from an underpayment, but watch this space\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\nIt is always a good idea to keep records of your pay and your pay slips. If this does become law there may be rules about how you claim the money but for the moment put your request in writing with your calculations.\nMoney. At the moment.\nPossibly, but only if you have to make an employment tribunal claim to recover any money owed to you.\nThis will be a controversial law. Some business leaders say there are already too many costs to do with employing people and that this added cost will prevent some organisations from growing and employing more people. However, there have been these sort of complaints for years now and the planet (and business) is still turning.\nYou will be able to make a claim at the employment tribunal under the Working Time Regulations 1998.\nThis is part of the big debate at the moment but if it becomes law, employers must think about this cost when they work out their annual budgets for payroll.\nIn theory this shouldn't happen. The case is moving on to the Court of Appeal so employers have time to either fall in with what might become established law now or alternatively make plans now.\nThe government's setting up a taskforce to look at the impact that this will have on business if it does become law. So there may be many changes yet to come. But even this is causing a row because it's said to be too much on the side of the employer, without enough representation from employee groups.\nFollow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube\nSummary:\nThe summary of the passage is that it's after a group of workers won their legal challenge for overtime to be included in their holiday pay.\nBusiness leaders say it could cost companies billions of pounds.

        "Write a short summary for the following passage:\nIt's after a group of workers won their legal challenge for overtime to be included in their holiday pay.\nBusiness leaders say it could cost companies billions of pounds. They claim some will be forced to close, meaning jobs will be lost.\nThe government was also worried about changing the current rules.\nBut there could still be an appeal, meaning a final decision might be years away.\nSo with lots of uncertainty around the ruling, employment lawyer Nickie Elenor answers some of the big questions...\nIf you regularly get overtime as part of your pay, you might have a claim. But it's thought the extra work will need to be so regular it's become a normal part of your salary. Exactly how regular that is is still unclear though. And if the overtime's voluntary, we still don't know if you'll benefit.\nLook at your average weekly pay over the three months before a week's leave. We think that's how much you'd be entitled to for your first four weeks holiday every tax year. If you get more than four weeks leave, you'll only receive basic pay for the rest of it, because companies don't have to give you that much time off.\nThat's a tricky one. Because this case is still going through the courts, it might take some time to become established law. Or the idea might get chucked out altogether. Until then, you could try writing to your employer to tell them that you know this is a rule that you believe is going to become law, therefore you believe they should pay and provide them with your calculation. Good Luck!\nWe've never heard of this happening, but that's not to say it doesn't happen.\nAnother tricky one. At the moment it looks like you won't be able to claim back more than three months from an underpayment, but watch this space\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\nIt is always a good idea to keep records of your pay and your pay slips. If this does become law there may be rules about how you claim the money but for the moment put your request in writing with your calculations.\nMoney. At the moment.\nPossibly, but only if you have to make an employment tribunal claim to recover any money owed to you.\nThis will be a controversial law. Some business leaders say there are already too many costs to do with employing people and that this added cost will prevent some organisations from growing and employing more people. However, there have been these sort of complaints for years now and the planet (and business) is still turning.\nYou will be able to make a claim at the employment tribunal under the Working Time Regulations 1998.\nThis is part of the big debate at the moment but if it becomes law, employers must think about this cost when they work out their annual budgets for payroll.\nIn theory this shouldn't happen. The case is moving on to the Court of Appeal so employers have time to either fall in with what might become established law now or alternatively make plans now.\nThe government's setting up a taskforce to look at the impact that this will have on business if it does become law. So there may be many changes yet to come. But even this is causing a row because it's said to be too much on the side of the employer, without enough representation from employee groups.\nFollow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube\nSummary:\nIt's after a group of workers won their legal challenge for overtime to be included in their holiday pay.
