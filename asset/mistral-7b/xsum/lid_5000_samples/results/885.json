Thousands of cyclists of all ages took part in the event, which was started by Sir Chris Hoy.\nVicky Strange, head of development at Cycling Scotland, said: \"To have such a big event now coming to Scotland for its first stage is just fantastic.\n\"The Tour of Britain is one of the biggest events on the calendar - it has really gained in profile.\n\"So to have the big names coming to Scotland and having these people - household names - right there on your doorstep and we can all get the chance to go and see them up close, I think is hugely inspirational for us.\"\nPast winners of the Tour of Britain's previous visits to Scotland are:\nLarge crowds gathered at the start and finish of the race will provide a boost for businesses in the area.\nDumfries and Galloway Council, which has hosted the event on a number of occasions, estimates the visitor expenditure at between \u00c2\u00a3250,000 and \u00c2\u00a3300,000.\nThere is also a further boost for accommodation providers with the huge entourage which follows a major cycling race.\nTelevision coverage of the race, which is beamed around the world, is seen as providing a major opportunity to raise the tourist profile of an area.\nIt has previously been estimated to translate to the equivalent of an advertising campaign costing hundreds of thousands of pounds.\nCouncils which have helped to host the event will hope it shows off the attractions of the west and south of Scotland to its very best.\nAcross the opening stage there was a breakaway attempt, and a bunch sprint finish on King Street looks a likely outcome.\nIf that is the case, there are few sporting scenes more dramatic than a huge group of cyclists hurtling at top speed in their multi-coloured kits.\nRival teams will battle in the final kilometres to try to get their lead-out \"train\" in position to give their best sprinter a chance of victory.\nSpectacular crashes are commonplace but, if he emerges unscathed, Mark Cavendish has to be among the favourites to take the win.\nSummary:\nThe opening stage of the week-long event is the only one in Scotland. The Grand Depart saw riders rolling out of Glasgow's George Square before doing a circuit of the city. They headed south, and have taken in Kilmarnock, Auchinleck, Cumnock and Dalmelling"
