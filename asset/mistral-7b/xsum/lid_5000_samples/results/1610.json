In primaries and caucuses he's won 37.1% of the vote and never more than 50% in any one primary.\nAs the Harvard political scientist Danielle Allen recently pointed out, Trump claims to be the spokesman of America's \"silent majority\" but, like so many of his boasts, it does not withstand close scrutiny.

To many, she fails the basic trust and likeability tests.\nSo with polls repeatedly suggesting that both Clinton and Trump are viewed unfavourably by a majority of Americans, with historically unprecedented negative ratings, America is heading towards a lesser of two evils style presidential election.\nTravels with Hillary - On the campaign bus with Clinton\nWomen problems - Clinton's struggle to appeal to female voters\nShouting row - Clinton's voice and tone under fire\nThe unpopularity of the front-runners is a reminder that we live in a \"None of the Above\" era of politics, in America and elsewhere.\nOut of the five remaining candidates, only two, Bernie Sanders and John Kasich, have positive approval ratings, but neither is translating that relative popularity into getting enough votes to win at present.\nPart of the reason for this none of the above dynamic is a rejection, globally, of the political class.

Their primary goal, their overriding motivation, frequently seems to be accruing power, rather than using it to effect change.\nTo many, figures like Hillary Clinton just seem too pre-programmed, too pragmatic and too overtly political.
