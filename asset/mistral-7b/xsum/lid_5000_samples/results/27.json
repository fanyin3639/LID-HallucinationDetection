It was so fast we were up several hundred feet before I realised we had actually left the ground.\"\nFlying the plane proved \"a big step up from training\".\n\"My first flights were at Fayed in Egypt where we had our operational training unit.\n\"You couldn't have dual control, they pointed out what to do and what controls to use and then you were on your own and away you go,\" he said.\n\"I enjoyed it very much.\"\nAt the end of the war, the planes were converted from fighters to fighter bombers.\n\"We carried a 500 lb bomb underneath the fuselage. We worked in close support with the 14th Army,\" he said.\n\"It was the monsoon period and you couldn't do high dive bombing, it was all low level stuff.\"\nHe was in the Far East when news came that the war was over.\n\"We were in the middle of Burma and we heard that the Japanese had definitely surrendered. We were really thrilled about that.\n\"A day or two later we moved down to near Rangoon, from there we were conveyed in the convoy down to Singapore.\n\"I spent the rest of my time in Singapore. After a couple of years I got back home. It was 1947, before I got back.\"\nFrom there, the Belfast man's life took a very different turn.\nHis early days of flight training were spent in what was then Rhodesia and is now Zimbabwe.
