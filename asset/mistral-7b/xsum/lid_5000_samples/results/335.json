They will update services currently offered in the L-band part of the radio spectrum.\nThese connections are handled today by the Inmarsat-4 series, which was launched in 2005. The expectation is that these earlier platforms will be operational until at least 2020, by which time the I-6s should be ready for lift-off.\nInmarsat's decision to place the order with Airbus is a major boost for UK space manufacturing.\nThe telecoms company is the world's biggest player in its field, and so the Airbus workers in Portsmouth and Stevenage will see the contract as a tremendous endorsement of their skills and expertise.\nIt will also be regarded as a very positive return on the strategy pursued by ministers and the UK Space Agency, who have targeted R&D investments in the telecoms sector.\nThis has seen, for example, the development of state-of-the-art digital signal processors for satellites that can channel significant bandwidth and power to specific locations on the ground at the drop of a hat.\nIn addition to being more capable than the I-4s, the I-6s will differ in two key respects.\nOne is their frequency of operation. As well as the L-band, which is where Inmarsat has many legacy services, the new satellites will carry a Ka-band payload.\nThis higher frequency part of the radio spectrum is where much of the new sector growth will occur - such as in-flight connections for aeroplanes.  Inmarsat recently launched an I-5 series of satellites. These all operate in Ka.\nThe other big difference from the I-4s, and indeed the I-5s, will be the new satellites' architecture. They will be what are called \"all-electric\" spacecraft.\nThis means they will use an ion engine to manoeuvre themselves once they come off the top of the launch rocket.\nThis is normally done with a large chemical thruster, but a significant mass saving can be made if the final orbital positioning is done using an engine that spits out a stream of charged gas.\nSuch ion engines, although extremely efficient, do however take longer to achieve the task in hand, resulting in a delay of several months to get the satellite on-station.\nThe plus side for the satellite owner is that they can use the mass saving either to select a smaller, cheaper rocket or to add additional payload capability.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos\nSummary:\nInmarsat, the world's biggest satellite telecoms company, has ordered two new spacecraft from Airbus.\nThe contract is a major boost for UK space manufacturing.\nThe new satellites will be able to operate in two frequency bands, and will be all-electric.\n\n2",
