Compared to other aircraft it was light on the controls, you could do all the aerobatics and you would come up to speed very quickly.\n\"If you treated a Spitfire properly, it treated you properly.

It also had a very fragile undercarriage and could collapse.\"\nMr Costain was a member of the RAF for 37 years.\nHe flew operational Spitfires over Europe, north Africa, the Middle East and Burma.\nHe was also a Spitfire instructor during that time and became a test pilot on Spitfires at 9MU Cosford, Shropshire.\nHe said: \"Everyone that joined the air force wanted to fly a Spitfire.\n\"I would say that I have flown nearly all of the operational Spitfires.\n\"There aren't many of us left [alive] that have flown the number of different marks of Spitfire that I have.\"\nDuring and since his flying days, Mr Costain says he has often been asked if he was frightened during the war years.\nHe said: \"I was terrified, but I was terrified of letting my own friends see that I was frightened.
