The red car is already an easier car to work with, with a wider operating window. On top of that, it has a more effective high-downforce package.\nIn trying to match the Ferrari on these types of tracks, the Mercedes runs up against its performance limits, and as the drivers push to try to match the Ferrari, the car becomes difficult to drive, prone to snaps at the rear in some corners, understeer - a lack of front grip - in others.\nAs Hamilton said in Hungary: \"When you drive it to a certain limit the car feels fine, but then you see Ferrari's time, you think you need to push further. So you drive 100% and the car is more on a knife edge.

There have long been rumours that he has some kind of pre-contractual arrangement with Mercedes, negotiated when he was doubting Ferrari's potential towards the end of a difficult 2016 season. But as far as this writer can ascertain that is not true.\nAnd while Hamilton is at Mercedes - he has a contract to the end of 2018 - it is hard to imagine Vettel going there, too. Partly because Vettel would be unlikely to fancy taking him on in the same team; and partly because Mercedes would be wary of putting two big beasts together (part of the reason why Alonso is not going there). And that's without considering the mammoth salary bill it would create.\nInsiders close to Vettel say there is no chance at all he won't stay at Ferrari. He has gone there to emulate his friend and childhood hero Michael Schumacher and replicate his success.\nBut there is a caveat.
