And he had out-manoeuvred the plotters.\nTo his supporters he has brought Turkey years of economic growth, but to his critics he is an autocratic leader intolerant of dissent who harshly silences anyone who opposes him.\nAnd dissenters range from a 16-year-old arrested for insulting the president to a former Miss Turkey who got into trouble for sharing a poem critical of the Turkish president.\nThe failed coup claimed at least 240 lives and, according to his officials, also came close to killing Mr Erdogan, who had been staying at the Aegean holiday resort of Marmaris.\nWithin hours, he appeared on national TV and rallied supporters in Istanbul, declaring he was the \"chief commander\".  But the strain on the president was clear, when he sobbed openly while giving a speech at the funeral of a close friend, shot with his son by soldiers during the attempted coup.\nMr Erdogan, 62, came to power in 2002, a year after the formation of the AK Party (AKP). He spent 11 years as Turkey's prime minister before becoming the country's first directly-elected president in August 2014 - a supposedly ceremonial role.\nHe is known to harbour ambitions of creating an executive presidency, to regain some of the powers he relinquished when his tenure as prime minister ended in 2014.\nWhile the AKP enjoys a fierce and loyal support among Turkey's conservative, Muslim base, his silencing of critics has caused alarm abroad.\nTurkish journalists have been investigated and put on trial, foreign journalists have been harassed and deported.\nAnd Mr Erdogan's authoritarian approach is not confined to Turkey's borders. His bodyguards harassed reporters in the US, and a German satirist is under investigation in his home country for offending the Turkish president on TV.\nIn June 2015 the AKP suffered a dip in the polls and failed to form a coalition.\nBut the party swept back to power in November with 49% of the vote, in elections overshadowed by the end of a ceasefire with the Kurdish militant PKK.\nBorn in 1954, Recep Tayyip Erdogan grew up the son of a coastguard, on Turkey's Black Sea coast.\nWhen he was 13, his father decided to move to Istanbul, hoping to give his five children a better upbringing.\nAs a teenager, the young Erdogan sold lemonade and sesame buns on the streets of Istanbul's rougher districts to earn extra cash.\nHe attended an Islamic school before obtaining a degree in management from Istanbul's Marmara University - and playing professional football.\n1970s-1980s - Active in Islamist circles, member of Necmettin Erbakan's Welfare Party\n1994-1998 - Mayor of Istanbul, until military officers made power grab\n1998 - Welfare Party banned, Erdogan jailed for four months for inciting religious hatred\nAug 2001 - Founds Islamist-rooted AKP (Justice and Development Party) with ally Abdullah Gul\n2002-2003 - AKP wins solid majority in parliamentary election, Erdogan appointed prime minister\nAug 2014 - Becomes president after first-ever direct elections for head of state\nJuly 2016 - Survives attempted coup by factions within the military\nIn the decades before the AKP's rise to power, the military intervened in politics four times to curb Islamist influence.\nAnd Recep Tayyip Erdogan has for years embraced Islamist-rooted politics.
