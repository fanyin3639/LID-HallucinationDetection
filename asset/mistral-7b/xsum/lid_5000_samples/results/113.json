People usually become infected after being scratched or bitten by a cat and experience swelling around the site of the scratch, and fatigue. It cannot be transmitted between people.\nCats are also the main carriers of the tiny T. gondii parasite that causes toxoplasmosis, but it's also found in dogs, sheep and cattle. The parasite is often found in the faeces of infected cats.\nYou may not know whether your cat is infected or not because cats don't usually show any symptoms.\nIf the parasite gets into the environment or food chain, it can be ingested by humans.\nThe greatest risk is to pregnant women, who could pass the infection on to their unborn baby, potentially causing brain damage and blindness, but severe congenital toxoplasmosis is rare - three in every 100,000 babies are born with the condition in the UK.\nUp to a third of the UK population will acquire a toxoplasmosis infection at some point in their life but most people won't notice any symptoms. If symptoms do appear, they will be similar to flu or glandular fever.\nA few years ago, the Health Protection Agency warned that families who keep reptiles as pets could be putting young children in the house at risk of a rare form of salmonella infection.\nThis is because reptiles, particularly snakes, carry the infection on their skin and shed it in their faeces.\nSalmonella infection in people usually causes a mild illness with fever, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Babies and young children are more likely to develop a serious illness.\nThe advice? \"Do not kiss your reptile,\" says Public Health England, and wash your hands thoroughly immediately after handling it.\nTicks can give both dogs and humans Lyme disease, but it is no more likely that a tick would transfer from pet to person than from human to hound.\nThe most common symptom is a red rash around the tick bite. Flu-like symptoms follow but if left untreated, Lyme disease can cause the joints to swell and lead to neurological problems.\nTicks that cause Lyme disease are commonly found in woodland and heath areas where dogs and their owners could be walking.\nRabies occurs mostly in dogs (and also in bats) but there is no risk to the general public in the UK from rabies in dogs.\nOnly four cases of human rabies from dogs have been identified in this country since 2000 - all of which were acquired from dogs abroad.\nRabies, a very serious viral infection, is usually transmitted through saliva from the bite of an infected dog. It causes a high fever and aggressive behaviour but it can also spread to the brain and nervous system, and can be fatal.\nDeveloping countries, particularly in South and South East Asia, see most of the 55,000 deaths from human rabies in the world each year.\nThe most common rodents kept as pets in the UK are rats, mice, gerbils, hamsters, agouti, guinea pigs and chinchilla.\nAll rodents, says Public Health England, whether pets or wild, can carry bacteria and viruses that cause infections in people.\nA current problem is hantavirus, a potentially life-threatening disease which has been found in a few people in England who handle pet rats.\nHantavirues can cause a range of diseases in humans - from a mild, flu-like illness to severe respiratory illness or kidney disease.\nOther infections that can be transmitted to humans include leptospirosis, rat bite fever and a type of meningitis caused by a virus called lymphocytic choriomeningitis.\nAlthough uncommon, these infections can have serious consequences.\nPsittacosis is a bacterial infection that affects birds, particularly parrots. It can also affect other exotic species such as budgies, cockatiels and macaws as well as ducks, gulls, sparrows and hens.\nIt is an airborne disease that can be passed on to humans through the inhalation of infected droplets from the bird's faeces, urine, feathers or saliva.\nIt can cause flu-like symptoms, such as a high temperature, headaches and muscle aches.\nIf left untreated, it can lead to p",

People usually become infected after being scratched or bitten by a cat and experience swelling around the site of the scratch, and fatigue.

The parasite is often found in the faeces of infected cats.\nYou may not know whether your cat is infected or not because cats don't usually show any symptoms.\nIf the parasite gets into the environment or food chain, it can be ingested by humans.\nThe greatest risk is to pregnant women, who could pass the infection on to their unborn baby, potentially causing brain damage and blindness, but severe congenital toxoplasmosis is rare - three in every 100,000 babies are born with the condition in the UK.\nUp to a third of the UK population will acquire a toxoplasmosis infection at some point in their life but most people won't notice any symptoms. If symptoms do appear, they will be similar to flu or glandular fever.\nA few years ago, the Health Protection Agency warned that families who keep reptiles as pets could be putting young children in the house at risk of a rare form of salmonella infection.\nThis is because reptiles, particularly snakes, carry the infection on their skin and shed it in their faeces.\nSalmonella infection in people usually causes a mild illness with fever, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Babies and young children are more likely to develop a serious illness.\nThe advice? \"Do not kiss your reptile,\" says Public Health England, and wash your hands thoroughly immediately after handling it.\nTicks can give both dogs and humans Lyme disease, but it is no more likely that a tick would transfer from pet to person than from human to hound.\nThe most common symptom is a red rash around the tick bite. Flu-like symptoms follow but if left untreated, Lyme disease can cause the joints to swell and lead to neurological problems.\nTicks that cause Lyme disease are commonly found in woodland and heath areas where dogs and their owners could be walking.\nRabies occurs mostly in dogs (and also in bats) but there is no risk to the general public in the UK from rabies in dogs.\nOnly four cases of human rabies from dogs have been identified in this country since 2000 - all of which were acquired from dogs abroad.\nRabies, a very serious viral infection, is usually transmitted through saliva from the bite of an infected dog.
